   Shenandoah GC in JDK 14, Part 1: Self-fixing barriers
   https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/03/04/shenandoah-gc-in-jdk-14-part-1-self-fixing-barriers/
   By Roman Kennke March 4, 2020
   The development of the Shenandoah Garbage Collector (GC) in the
   upcoming JDK 14 has seen significant improvements. The first one
   covered here (self-fixing barriers) aims to reduce local latencies
   that are spent in barrier mid- and slow paths. The second will cover
   concurrent root processing and concurrent class unloading.
   
   https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/03/09/shenandoah-gc-in-jdk-14-part-2-concurrent-roots-and-class-unloading/
   This article discusses concurrent roots processing and concurrent
   class unloading, both of which aim to reduce GC pause time by moving
   GC work from the pause to a concurrent phase.

  - lines()  : returns string[] that collects all substrings split by lines.
    System.out.println(
       "JD\nJD\nJD".str.lines().collect(Collectors.toList())
    );
  - strip()         : similar to trim() but unicode-aware
    stripLeading()
    stripTrailing()
  - repeat(int n)     : repeats string  n times.


- Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters (JEP 323)

  - While it's possible to  just skip the type in the lambda
    it becomes a need when for annotations like @Nullable

- Nested Based Access Control
  (fix some issues when using (discouraged-)reflection.

- Dynamic Class-File Constants(JEP 309)
  - class-file format now extends support a new constant pool form:
    -ºCONSTANT_Dynamicº, reduce the cost and disruption of developing
      new forms of materializable class-file constraints.

- Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector(JEP 318):
  - Experimental
  - Unlike the JVM GC which is responsible for allocating memory
    and releasing it, Epsilon only allocates memory. Useful for:
    -ºExtremely short lived jobsº

  - Read also: https://aboullaite.me/docker-java-10/
    JVMs before 10 had been implemented before cgroups, hence not 
    optimized for executing inside a container.

- Application Data-Class Sharing (JEP ???)
  -  extends existing Class-Data Sharing ("CDS")
     for allowing application classes to be placed in
     the shared archive in order to improve startup
     and footprint.
- Parallel Full GC for G1
  - improves G1 worst-case latencies
- Garbage Collector Interface
  - improves source code isolation of different GCs.
- Consolidate JDK Forest into a Single Repository
- Local-Variable Type Inference
  - declarations of local variables with initializers
  - introducesºvarº
- Remove Native-Header Generator Tool (javah)
  superseded by superior functionality in javac.
- Thread-Local Handshakes:
  - Allows to execute a callback on threads without
    performing a global VM safepoint. Makes it both
    possible and cheap to stop individual threads and
    not just all threads or none.
- Time-Based Release Versioning
- Root Certificates, providing a default set of root
  CAs in the JDK.
- Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices:
  - enables the HotSpot VM to allocate the Java object
    heap on an alternative memory device, such as an
    NV-DIMM, specified by the user.

  └ Memory Configuration for containers
    -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
    -XX:+UseGroupMemoryLimitFoHeap
    - set -XX:MaxRAMFraction to 2 (default is 4) 

- Java Platform Module System:
  - based on Project Jigsaw
  - divides the JDK into a set of modules for
    combining at run, compile, or build time.
  - enabling understanding of dependencies across modules.
  - allows developers to more easily assemble and
    maintain sophisticated applications.
  - allows to scale down to smaller devices.
  - improves security and performance.
  - aspects include:
    - application packaging
    - JDK modularization
    - reorganizing source code into modules.
    - Build system is enhanced to compile modules
      and enforce module boundaries at build time.
  (Java 9 allows illegal reflective access to help migration)

- Reactive Streams:
(https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.1/README.md#specification)
  is a small spec, also adopted in Java 9, that defines the interaction 
  between asynchronous components with back pressure. For example a 
  data repository — acting as Publisher, can produce data that an 
  HTTP server — acting as Subscriber, can then write to the 
  response. The main purpose of Reactive Streams is to allow the 
  subscriber to control how fast or how slow the publisher will produce 
  data.

- ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation (experimental)
  - improve startup time, with limited impact on peak performance.
-ºREPL (read-eval-print loop)º
  - jShell: interactively evaluates statements "a la script".
    - tab completion
    - automatic addition of needed terminal semicolons.
    - jShell API for IDE integration.

  - jShell: interactively evaluates statements "a la script".

- Streams API Enhancements
  - Java 8 Stream API allows processing data declaratively
    while leveraging multicore architectures.
  - Java 9 adds methods to conditionally take and drop items
    from Stream, iterate over Stream elements, and create a
    stream from a nullable value while expanding the set of
    Java SE APIs that can serve as Streams sources.

- Code cache can be divided in Java 9
  - code cache can now be divided into segments to
    improve performance and allow extensions such as
    fine-grained locking resulting in improved sweep
    times
- (Datagram Transport Layer Security) DTLS security API
  - prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery
    in client/server communications.

- Java 9 deprecates and removes:
  - Applet API and appletviewer (alternative: Java Web Start)
  - Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) GC.
  - JVM TI (Tool Interface) hprof (Heap Profiling) agent,
    superseded in the JVM.
  - jhat tool, obsoleted by superior heap visualizers and analyzers.

<span xsmall>JVM Safepoints</span>
- @[http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2015/12/safepoints.html]    [TODO]
   - Definition: Mutator threads: threads which manipulate the JVM heap.
     all Java Threads are mutators, Non-Java (native?) threads may also be
     regarded as mutators when they call into JVM APIs which interact with the heap.
   - Safepoint:
     - range of execution where the state of the executing thread
       is well described since thread is NOT interacting with the heap:
     - used to put mutator threads on hold while the JVM 'fixes stuff up'
     - particularly useful to let JVM examine|change the heap (GC, ...)
       (no objects still alive and referenced from the stack)
   - thread is at safepoints when: 
     - thread de-scheduling events: thread blocked on lock/synch.lock, waiting on a monitor, parked,
       or blocked on blocking-IO. 
     - thread is executing JNI code.
   - thread is NOT at safepoints when: 
     - executing bytecode (maybe, but not for sure).
     - thread interrupted (by the OS) while not at a safepoint.
   - JVM cannot force any thread into a safepoint state but ...
     JVM can stop threads from leaving a safepoint state.
     Q: How then bring ALL threads into a safepoint:
     A: Java threads poll a 'safepoint flag' (global or thread level) at 'reasonable' intervals
        and transition into a safepoint state (thread is blocked at a safepoint) when active. 
        Q: how to avoid waste time checking if C1/C2 (client/server) JIT compilers need to stop?
           how to keep safepoint polls to a minimum. 
        A: considerations combined lead to the following locations for safepoint polls:
           - Between any 2 bytecodes while running in the interpreter (effectively)
           - On 'non-counted' loop back edge in C1/C2 compiled code
           - Method entry (Zing,...) or exit (OpenJDK,...) in C1/C2 compiled code.
    Ex:
    public class WhenWillItExit {
      public static void main(String[] argc)
        throws InterruptedException {
        const UP = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        final Thread t = new Thread(() -˃ {

            }                                 │  int-type loops:   'counted' code.ºNo safepoints injected.º

    (See original source for many interesing details on safepoint tunning) 

  BºSUMMARY:º
     - Safepoint polls are dispersed at fairly arbitrary points and depending
       on execution mode, mostly at uncounted loop back edge or method return/entry.
     - Bringing the JVM to aºGLOBAL safepointºis high cost
   ☞ - For real-time applications,Bºit's critical to know about safepointsº
       avoiding 'counted' code.
     -XX:+PrintApplicationStoppedTime will log contained safepoint pauses.

BºProblems with (most) Sampling Profilersº:
- @[http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-most-sampling-java-profilers-are.html]
  - A large number of samples needed to get statistically significant results.
  - profiler should sample all points in a program run with equal probability
  - Generic profilers rely on the JVMTI spec:
    - JVMTI offers Rºonly safepoint sampling stack trace collection optionsº:
      - Rºonly the safepoint polls in the running code are visibleº skipping optimizedº
        Rº(counted-code) for-loops!!!º
      - Rºsamples are biased towards the next available safepoint poll locationº
      - A sample profiler can blame a "cheap method" 9 levels down the stack when the
        real culprit is the topmost method loop.

In practical terms, there is only one set of source code for the JDK. 

- Anyone can take that source code,build and publish it.
- The certification process ensures that the build is valid.
- Certification run by the Java Community Process, which provides a 
  Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK, sometimes referred to as the JCK). 
  If build passes the TCK then it is described as "Java SE compatible".
  Note: Built can NOT be referred to as "Java SE" without paying a commercial
        license from Oracle.
        Ex: AdoptOpenJDK passing TCK are "Java SE compatible" (vs "Java SE").
  -RºWARNº: certification is currently on a trust-basis: results are 
            not submitted to the JCP/Oracle for checking, neither can
            be made public.

JAVA MEMORY MODEL:

─────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────

         │ - exception handler params  │ - array elements

* 1: Ref(erence) types on the stack point to real object in HEAP memory.

Reference Types regarding how the object on the heap is eligible for garbage collection
┌─────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STRONG  │ - Most popular.
│         │ - The object on the heap it is not garbage collected
│         │   while there is a strong reference pointing to it, or if it is
│         │   strongly reachable through a chain of strong references.
├─────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ WEAK    │ - most likely to not survive after the next garbage collection process.
│         │ - Is created like
│         │    WeakReference˂StringBuilder˃ reference =
│         │     = new WeakReference˂˃(new StringBuilder());
│         │ - ºEx.use case: caching:º
│         │   We let the GC remove the object pointed to by the weak reference,

├─────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ SOFT    │ - used for more memory-sensitive scenarios

│         │ - ºJava guarantees that all soft referenced objectsº

<span xsmall>Force string pool reuse</span>
- Strings are immutable.
- Stored on the heap
- Java manages a string pool in memory,
  reusing strings whenever possible.

String string01 = "297",                                string01 == string02 : true
       string02 = "297",                                string01 == string03 : Rºfalseº *1
       string03 = new Integer(297).toString(),          string01 == string04 : true  *2
       string04 = new Integer(297).toString()º.intern()º; *2

º1: RºPool reuse does not work for dynamically created strings*
*2: If we consider that the computed String will be used quite often,
    we can force the JVM to add it to the string pool by adding the
    .intern() method at the end of computed string:

<pre zoom labels="jvm,cache,performance">
<span xsmall>"MARK&amp;SWEEP"</span>
JVM analyzes the variables from the stack and "marks" all the objects that need to be kept alive.
Then, all the unused objects are cleaned up.

The more garbage there is, and the fewer that objects are marked alive, the faster the process is.

To optimize even more heap memory actually consists of multiple parts (Java 8+):

<span xsmall>Optimization Tips</span>
- To minimize the memory footprint, limit the scope of the variables as much as possible.

- Explicitly refer to null obsolete references making them eligible for GC.

- Avoid finalizers. They slow down the process and they do not guarantee anything.
  Prefer phantom references for cleanup work.

- Do not use strong references where weak or soft references apply.
 ºThe most common memory pitfalls are caching scenarios,when dataº
 ºis held in memory even if it might not be needed.º

- Explicitly specify heap size for the JVM when running the application:
  -  allocate a reasonable initial and maximum amount of memory for the heap.
   OºInitial heap size -Xms512m º – set initial heap     size to  512 megabytes
   OºMaximum heap size -Xmx1024mº – set maximum heap     size to 1024 megabytes
   OºThread stack size -Xss128m º – set thread stack     size to  128 megabytes
   OºYoung genera.size -Xmn256m º – set young generation size to  256 megabytes

<span xsmall>˂˂AutoClosable˃˃ (1.7+)</span>
- The java garbage collector can not automatically clean any
  other resource appart from memory. All resources related to
  I/O (virtual/physical devices) must be closed programatically,
  for example sockets, http connections, database connections, ...
  since neither the compiler, not the runtime can not take control of
  external (non-controlled) devices/resources.

  Java 1.7+ includes the interface java.lang.AutoClosable to simplify
  the resource cleaning.

  When a class representing an external resource implement this 
  interface and isºused inside a try-with-resourcesº, its close
  method will be invoqued automatically (the compiler will add 
  the required code).

  Most core java I/O classes  already implemente this interface.

  Ex:
  public class MyClassWithExternalResources 
  implements ºjava.lang.AutoCloseableº, ... {
        private final MyExternalEventListener listener;
        private final MyIODevice device;
        private final MyHTTPConnection connection;
        ...
       ºpublic void close()º{
            listener  .close();
            device    .close();
            connection.close();
        }
        ...
    }

    public class SomeLongRunningClass {
      ...
      void useManyResourcesManyTimes(String path)  {

        for (int repeat=0; repeat˂100; repeat++) {
         ºtry (MyClassWithExternalResources i = º
              º new MyClassWithExternalResources(...))º {
                ...

            //

         º// At this point all resouces have been closed.  º
         º// If a runtime exception exits the function the º

<a xsmall href='https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/java9-cldr-ldml'>Java 9</a>
- A number of parsing and formatting changes have been incorporated in Java 9 to
bring the functionality closer to Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML).
These changes have been supervised by Stephen Colebourne, creator of the popular
 date-time library JodaTime, precursor of the new java.time component in Java 8.
Abiding by the Unicode standard will provide better interoperability with other
non-Java systems.

- LDML is the language used by the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR),
  a project of the Unicode Consortium to gather and store locale data from
  different parts of the world, enabling application developers to better adapt
  their programs to different cultures. Among other things, LDML deals with dates,
  times, and timezones, and more particularly with date formatting and parsing.
  The following is an extract of new features coming in Java 9 that bring java.time
  closer to the LDML specification:

  - JDK-8148947, DateTimeFormatter pattern letter ‘g’: the letter ‘g’, as
    specified in LDML, indicates a “Modified Julian day”; this is different from a
    normal Julian day in the sense that a) it depends on local time, rather than GMT,
    and b) it demarcates days at midnight, as opposed to noon.
  - JDK-8155823, Add date-time patterns 'v' and 'vvvv’: ‘v’ and ‘vvvv’ are LDML
    formats to indicate “generic non-location format”, e.g. “Pacific Time”, as
    opposed to the “generic location format” with specifies a city, like
    “Los Angeles Time”.
  - JDK-8148949, DateTimeFormatter pattern letters ‘A’, ’n’, ’N’: although LDML
    doesn’t specify formats ’n’ and ’N’, it does specify ‘A’, but the current
    behaviour in Java doesn’t match that of the spec. ‘A’ is meant to represent the
    total number of milliseconds elapsed in the day, with variable width, but
    currently Java treats this as fixed with: if ‘AA’ is specified as a pattern, it
    will fail to parse any value that is further than 99 milliseconds in the day.
    ’n’ and ’N’ are just Java extensions to the standard to represent nanoseconds
    within the second, and nanoseconds within the day, respectively.
  - JDK-8079628, java.time DateTimeFormatter containing "DD" fails on three-digit
    day-of-year value: similar to the previous problem, but with ‘D’ representing
    days within a year. If one specifies “DD” as a pattern, it will fail to parse
    “123” as the 123th day of the year.
- As previously mentioned, a better alignment with the LDML will ease
  interoperability across systems, since there are multiple technologies that
  have adopted the LDML to some degree. Microsoft .NET uses LDML for general
  interexchange of locale data, and there are packages available for Node.js
  and Ruby, just to mention a few.

<span xsmall>MDC: "Better Way of Logging"</span>
@[https://dzone.com/articles/mdc-better-way-of-logging-1]
RºPROBLEMº: How do we related logs together originating 
            from a (single user, single data-flow)
            that are processed by different threads, HTTP
            requests (think of Single Page Apps),
            or component?
GºSOLUTIONº: Use mapped diagnostic context (MDC). 

BºMapped Diagnostic Contextº:
  - Built into the logging framework,
    it is supported by log4j, log4j2, and SL4J/logback.
  - Allows to capture custom ºkey/valueº diagnostic data, 
    accessible to the appender when the log message is actually 
    written. 
  - MDC structure isºinternally attachedºto the executing threadº
  in the same way a ThreadLocal variable would be.

BºMDC How To:º
  - At the start of the thread, fill MDC with custom information 
    (MDC API also allows to remove info later on if it doesn't apply)
  - Log the message
  - MDCºSummarized APIº:                                   
    public class MDC {
      publicºstaticºvoid   put   (String key, String val); // ← Add to ºcurrent Threadº
      publicºstaticºString get   (String key);                         ºContext Mapº
      publicºstaticºvoid   remove(String key);
      publicºstaticºvoid clear(); // ← Clear all entries
    }
    NOTE: child threads does not automatically inherit a copy of 
           the current diagnostic context.

  - Best pattern for microservices:
    - 
      Ex: 
      //ºSTEP 1:ºOverride Qºinterceptor layerº
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      //                """single place where call  
      //                   execution passes through""".
      public class ServiceInterceptor
        extendsQºHandlerInterceptorAdapterº{
      
          private final staticºLogger LOGGERº=
                  Logger.getLogger(ServiceInterceptor.class);   
      
        Qº@Overrideº
          public boolean preHandle(
                   HttpServletRequest request,
                   HttpServletResponse response,
                   Object object) throws Exception {
             MDC.put("userId"    , request.getHeader("UserId"   ));
             MDC.put("sessionId ", request.getHeader("SessionId"));
             MDC.put("requestId" , request.getHeader("RequestId"));
      }

      //ºSTEP 2:ºChange log appender pattern to retrieve variables 
      //         stored in the MDC.
      ˂appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender"˃ 
      ˂layout˃
      ˂Pattern˃%X{userId} %X{sessionId} %X{requestId} - %m%n˂/Pattern˃
      ˂/layout˃ 
      ˂/appender˃

      Log output will look some like:
      17:53:25,496 http─8080─20 INFO Service1.execute(77)  U1001 ┌ sessId01    ┌ reqId_1_1   req service 1

- JDK 1.8+
- Incomplete but good enough to cover the "shape" of many lambda expressions and
 method references representing abstract concepts like functions, actions, or predicates
- The @FunctionalInterface is used to capture design intent (not needed by compiler).
- In documenting functional interfaces, or referring to variables typed as
  functional interfaces, it is common to refer directly to those abstract concepts,
  for example using "this function" instead of "the function represented by this object".
- Each functional interface has a single abstract method, called the functional method for that
  functional interface, to which the lambda expression's parameter and return types are matched or adapted.
- Functional interfaces can provide a target type in multiple contexts, such as assignment context, method invocation,
  or cast context:
  |Predicate˂String˃ p = String::isEmpty;           // Assignment context
  |stream.filter(e -˃ e.getSize() ˃ 10)...          // Method invocation context
  |stream.map((ToIntFunction) e -˃ e.getSize())...  // Cast context

@1 NavigableMap: SortedMap with additional methods for finding entries
                 by their ordered position in the key set.
                 So potentially this can remove the need for iterating
                 in the first place - you might be able to find the
                 specific entry you are after using the higherEntry,
                 lowerEntry, ceilingEntry, or floorEntry methods. The
                 descendingMap method even gives you an explicit method
                 of reversing the traversal order.

@[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/948194/difference-between-java-enumeration-and-iterator]

- both interfaces will give successive elements

- Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from
  the underlying collection during the iteration with
  well-defined semantics.
  (additional remove method)
- Iterators Method names have been improved.

- Iterators are fail-fast:
  - If thread A changes the collection, while
       thread B is traversing it, the iterator implementation
       will try to throw a ConcurrentModificationException
       (best effort since it can not always be guaranteed)
  - The fail-fast behavior of iterators can be used only to
    detect bugs sin the best effort doesn't warrant its trigger.
  - newer 'concurrent' collections will never throw it.
    Reading thread B will traverse the collection "snapshot" at
    the start of read.



-ºIterator should be preferred over Enumerationº
  taking the place of Enumeration in collections framework

<span xsmall>SELECTORS</span>
@[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/Selector.html]

- A Selector allows a single thread to manage multiple channels 
  (network connections), by examining which ones are ready for 
  connect,accept,read,write

- A channel that "fires an event" is also said to be "ready" for that event.

     called select() on:

<span xsmall>FileChannel</span>
- Java NIO FileChannel: channel connected to a file allowing to
      read data from  and write data to a file.
- A FileChannel canNOT be set into non-blocking mode:
  It always runs in blocking mode

- Reading from FileChannel (Writting to buffer):
  |/* You cannot open a FileChannel directly,
  | * first you obtain a FileChannel via an (Input|Output)Stream or a RandomAccessFile
  | */
  |RandomAccessFile GºaFileº     = new RandomAccessFile("data/nio-data.txt", "rw");
  |// Reading from channel
  |try (  /* try-with 1.7+ */
  |  RandomAccessFile GºaFileº = new RandomAccessFile("data/nio-data.txt", "rw")
  |) throws IOException {
  |  FileChannel BºinChannelº = GºaFileº.getChannel();
  |
  |  ByteBuffer Oºbufº = ByteBuffer.allocate(48 /* capacity*/);
  |
  |  int ºbytesReadº = BºinChannelº.read(Oºbufº); // Oºbufº now in write mode
  |  while (ºbytesReadº != -1) {
  |    Oºbufº.flip();                            // Oºbufº now in read mode
  |    while(Oºbufº.hasRemaining()){
  |        // alt. read data directly, 1 byte at a time
  |        System.out.print((char) Oºbufº.get());
  |        // alt. read data in channel
  |        // anotherChannel.write(Oºbufº)
  |    }
  |
  |    Oºbufº.clear(); //make buffer ready for writing
  |    ºbytesReadº = BºinChannelº.read(Oºbufº); // Oºbufº now in write mode
  |  }

- Writing to a FileChannel (reading from buffer)
  | String newData = "......" + System.currentTimeMillis();
  | ByteBuffer Oºbufº = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
  | Oºbufº.clear();
  | Oºbufº.put(newData.getBytes());
  | Oºbufº.flip(); // change buffer from write to read
  | ºwhile(Oºbufº.hasRemaining()) {º channelOº.writeº(Oºbufº); º}º
  | channel.close();


- FileChannel Position
  | long pos = fileChannel.position(); // obtain current position
  | fileChannel.position(pos +123); // change position

   - If you set the position after the end of the file,
     and try to read from the channel, you will get -1
   - If you set the position after the end of the file,
     and write to the channel, the file will be expanded
     to fit the position and written data. This may result
     in a "file hole", where the physical file on
     the disk has gaps in the written data.

- FileChannel Size
  | long fileSize = fileChannel.size();
                                ^^^^^^
                            size of the file
                            connected to channel

- FileChannel (file) Truncate
  | fileChannel.truncate(1024 /*length*/);

- FileChannel Force:
  flushes all unwritten data from the channel and OS cache to the disk
  | channel.force(true /* flush also file meta-data like permissions....*/);

<span xsmall>NonBlocking Server</span>
REF:
- @[http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/non-blocking-server.html]
- @[https://github.com/jjenkov/java-nio-server]
- Non-blocking IO Pipelines:
read-write pipeline: ºchannelInº → selector → component → ... → componentN → ºchannelOutº
read-only  pipeline: ºchannelInº → selector → component → ... → componentN
write-only pipeline:                        component → ... → componentN → ºchannelOutº
Note: It is the component that initiates reading of data from the Channel via the Selector
read-pipeline read from stream/channelIn and split data into messages like:

Data   → Message → Message
Stream   Reader    Stream

-ºA blocking Message Reader/Writer is simpler, since itº
 ºhas never to handle situations where no data was readº
 ºfrom the stream, or where only a partial message wasº
 ºread from the stream and message parsing needs to beº
 ºresumed later.º
-ºThe drawback of blocking is the requirement of separateº
 ºthreads for each parallel stream, which is a problem if theº
 ºserver has thousands of concurrent connectionsº
- Each thread will take between 320K (32 bit JVM) and
  1024K (64 bit JVM) memory for its stack
- Queue messages can be used to reduce the problem. However,
  this design requires that the inbound client  streams
  send data reasonably often and input is processed fast.
   If the inbound client stream may be inactive for longer periods
  attached to hidden clients, a high number of inactive
  connections may actually block all the threads in the thread
  pool.
  That means that the server becomes slow to respond or even
  unresponsive.
- A non-blocking IO pipeline can use a single thread to
  read messages from multiple non-blocking streams.
    When in non-blocking mode, a stream may return 0 or more
  bytes when you attempt to read data from it.
  When you call select() or selectNow() on the Selector it
  gives you only the SelectableChannel instances ("connected
  clients") that actually has data to read.

OºComponent ──→ STEP 1: select() ──→ Selector ←──┬─→ Channel1º
Oº    ↑                                │         ┼─→ Channel2º
Oº    └───← STEP 2: ready channels ←───┘         └─→ Channel3º


- Reading Partial Messages: Data sent by "ready" channels can
  contain fractions/incomplete messages:
  - The Message Reader looks needs to check if the data block
    contains at least one full message, adn storing partial ones.
    (maybe using one Message Reader per Channel to avoid mixing messages)
  - To store Partial Messages two design should be considered:
    - copy data as little as possible for better performance
    - We want full messages to be stored in consecutive byte to
      make parsing messages easier
  - Some protocol message formats are encoded using a TLV format
    (Type, Length, Value).
    Memory management is much easier since we known immediately
    how much memory to allocate for the message. No memory is
    wasted at the end of a buffer that is only partially used.
  - The fact that TLV encodings makes memory management easier is
    one of the reasons why HTTP 1.1 is such a terrible protocol.
    That is one of the problems trying to be fixed in HTTP 2.0 where
    data is transported in LTV encoded frames.
  - Writing Partial Messages: channelOut.write(ByteBuffer) in
    non-blocking mode gives no guarantee about how many of the
    bytes in the ByteBuffer is being written. The method returns
    how many bytes were written, so it is possible to keep track
    of the number of written bytes.
  - Just like with the Message Reader, a Message Writer is used
    per channel to handle all the details.
   (partial writes, message queues, resizable buffers, protocol aware tricks,...)

-ºAll in all a non-blocking server ends up with three "pipelines" itº
 ºneeds to execute regularly:º
  - The read pipeline which checks for new incoming data from
    the open connections.
  - The process pipeline which processes any full messages received.
  - The write pipeline which checks if it can write any outgoing
    messages to any of the open connections

- "efficient by default".

- HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
- Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn't available).
- Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
- Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.

- OkHttp perseveres when the network is troublesome: it will silently recover
  from common connection problems.
BºIf target service has multiple IP addresses OkHttp will attempt alternate
  addresses if the first connect failsº.
BºThis is necessary for IPv4+IPv6 and for services hosted in redundant data centersº.

   OkHttp supports modern TLS features (TLS 1.3, ALPN, certificate pinning). It
  can be configured to fall back for broad connectivity.

- request/response API is designed with ºfluent builders and immutabilityº

<span xsmall>Uber JVM Profiler: Tracing at scale</span>
@[https://eng.uber.com/jvm-profiler/]
Our JVM Profiler supports a variety of use cases, most notably making 
it possible to instrument arbitrary Java code. Using a simple 
configuration change, the JVM Profiler can attach to each executor in 
a Spark application and collect Java method runtime metrics. Below, 
we touch on some of these use cases:
- Right-size executor: We use memory metrics from the JVM Profiler 
  to track actual memory usage for each executor so we can set the 
  proper value for the Spark “executor-memory” argument.
- Monitor HDFS NameNode RPC latency: We profile methods on the 
  class org.apache.hadoop.hdfs...ClientNamenodeProtocolTranslatorPB 
  in a Spark application and identify long latencies on NameNode calls. 
  We monitor more than 50 thousand Spark applications each day with 
  several billions of such RPC calls.
- Monitor driver dropped events: We profile methods like 
  org.apache.spark.scheduler.LiveListenerBus.onDropEvent to trace 
  situations during which the Spark driver event queue becomes too long 
  and drops events.
- Trace data lineage: We profile file path arguments on the method 
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs...getBlockLocations and 
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs...addBlock 

Uber JVM Profiler provides a Java Agent to collect various metrics 
and stacktraces for Hadoop/Spark JVM processes in a distributed way, 
for example, CPU/Memory/IO metrics.

Uber JVM Profiler also provides advanced profiling capabilities to 
trace arbitrary Java methods and arguments on the user code without 
user code change requirement. This feature could be used to trace 
HDFS name node call latency for each Spark application and identify 
bottleneck of name node. It could also trace the HDFS file paths each 
Spark application reads or writes and identify hot files for further 
optimization.

This profiler is initially created to profile Spark applications 
which usually have dozens of or hundreds of processes/machines for a 
single application, so people could easily correlate metrics of these 
different processes/machines. It is also a generic Java Agent and 
could be used for any JVM process as well.

  ...
- If caches are so in-sync with one another, why do we need volatiles at all in
  languages like Java?

  That’s a very complicated question that’s better answered elsewhere, but
  let me just drop one partial hint. Data that’s read into CPU registers, is
  not kept in sync with data in cache/memory. The software compiler makes all
  sorts of optimizations when it comes to loading data into registers, writing it
  back to the cache, and even reordering of instructions. This is all done
  assuming that the code will be run single-threaded. Hence why any data that is
  at risk of race-conditions, needs to be manually protected through concurrency
  algorithms and language constructs such as atomics and volatiles.

 ☞In the case of Java volatiles, part of the solution is to force all
  reads/writes to bypass the local registers, and immediately trigger cache
  reads/writes instead. As soon as the data is read/written to the L1 cache, the
  hardware-coherency protocol takes over and provides guaranteed coherency across
  all global threads. Thus ensuring that if multiple threads are reading/writing
  to the same variable, they are all kept in sync with one another. And this is
  how you can achieve inter-thread coordination in as little as 1ns.

<span xsmall>Concurrency Basics</span>
- Concurrency problems arise from the desire to use CPU resources more efficiently. Non concurrent
  applications (single threaded/single process) are complete Touring machines that can potentially
  solve any problem with enough time and memory. In practice having a CPU assigned to single thread
  will be very inneficient since the CPU will stand-by while the thread is waiting for input/output
  operations. Also, many algorithms allows to split processed data in isolated regions that can be
  processed in parallel by different CPU/CPU cores
- Concurrent tries to solve the problem of multiple independents CPUs or threads accesing share
  resources (memory)
- Locks is the simples concurrent primite to protect code or data from concurrent
  access in situations where there are many threads of execution. Locks can be classified like:
  | According to lock ussage:
  |    Cooperative   A thread is encouraged (but not forced) to cooperate with other
  |                  threads by adquiring a lock before accessing the associated data
  |
  |    Mandatory     a thread trying to access an already locked resource will throw
  |                  an exception
  | _________________________________________________
  | According to lock rescheduing strategy:
  |    Blocking      The OS block the thread requesting the lock and rescheduled another thread
  |
  |    Spinlock      The thread waits in a loop until the requested lock becomes available.
  |                  It's more efficient if threads are blocked for very short time (smaller than
  |                  the time needed by the OS to reschedule another thread into the current CPU)
  |                  It's inneficient if the lock is held for a long time since a CPU core is
  |                  waisted on the spinlock loop
  | _________________________________________________
  | According to granularity: (measure of the ammount of data the lock is protecting)
  |    Coarse        Protect large segments of data (few locks). Results in less lock overhead
  |                  for a single thread, but worse performance for many threads running concurrently
  |                  (most thread will be lock-contended waiting for share resource access)
  |
  |    Fine          Protect small amounts of data. Require more lock instances reducing lock
                     contention

- Locks require CPU atomic instructions for efficient implementations suchs as
    "test-and-set", "fetch-and-add", or "compare-and-swap", whether there are blocking
    (managed by the OS) or spinlocks (managed by the thread)
- Uniprocessors can just disable interruptions to implement locks, while multiprocessors
  using shared-memory will require complex hardware and/or software support
-  ºMonitors wrap mutex-locks with condition variables (container of threads waitingº
   ºfor certain condition)º. They are implemented as thread-safe classes
</pre>
<pre zoom labels="concurrency,101" >
<span xsmall>monitors</span>
-ºObject providing Mutual exclusion of threads to shared resourcesº
- simplest form of synchronization:
  alternatives include:
  - reads and writes of volatile variables
  @[https://avaldes.com/examining-volatile-keyword-with-java-threads-example/]
    typically used in applications when one thread will
    be making changes to the variables and the others all reading or
    consumers of the data. If you have multiple threads making changes to
    the data it will be best to stick with synchronized block or use
    java.util.concurrent library package.
    (volatile is actually simpler than monitors, but not universal)
    Important Points on Volatile Variables:
    - Volatile variables areºnot cached in registers or in cachesº:
     ºAll read and writes are done in main memory, never done thread-locallyº
    - Example Ussage: status flags used in spin loops
    - Volatile keywordºguarantees visibility and orderingº
  - use of classes in the java.util.concurrent package
- Monitors also have the ability to wait(block a thread) for a certain condition
  to become true, and signal other threads that their condition has been met
-ºMonitors provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access inº
 ºorder to wait for some condition to be met, before regaining exclusive access and  º
 ºresuming their taskº
- each java object can be used as a monitor.
- Methods/blocks of code requiring mutual exclusion must be explicitly marked with the
Oºsynchronized keywordº:
  - The synchronized statement computes a reference to an object;
    it then attempts to perform a lock action on that object's monitor and does not
    proceed further until the lock action has successfully completed.
    After the lock action has been performed, the body of the synchronized statement
    is executed. If execution of the body is ever completed, either normally or abruptly,
    an unlock action is automatically performed on that same monitor.
  - RºWARNº: The Java programming language neither prevents nor requires detection
    of deadlock conditions.
- Instead of explicit condition variables, each monitor(/object) is equipped with
  a single wait queue in addition to its entrance queue.
- All waiting is done on this singleOºwait queueº and allOºnotify/notifyAllº
  operations apply to this queue.

[java.util.concurrent]

@[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html]


- Object allowing 1+ threads to wait until a 1+ operations are completed in other threads.

- CountDownLatch: versatile synchronization tool used for:
  -ºon/off latch or gate:º
    When initialized to "one", parallel processing threads will
    invoke "await" and standby waiting for a "control" thread to
    open the gate with countDown().
  -ºparallel thread synchonization:º (barriers, ...)
    When initialized to 2+, it can be used to make a thread
    wait until "N" processing threads complete their task,
    (or 1+ proccesing threads complet an action N times).

  BºNOTEº: 
  - Threads calling countDown() can continue processing before count reach 0.
    Only threads invoquing await will wait.

- The first is a start signal that 
  prevents any worker from proceeding until the driver is ready for 
  them to proceed; The second is a completion signal that allows the 
  driver to wait until all workers have completed.

  -  Ex. 1:
     class DriverThread { // ...

       class Worker implements Runnable {
         private final CountDownLatch OºstartSignalº;
         private final CountDownLatch BºdoneSignalº;
         Worker(CountDownLatch OºstartSignalº, CountDownLatch BºdoneSignalº) {
          Oºthis.startSignal = startSignalº;
          Bºthis.doneSignal  = doneSignalº;
         }
         public void run() {
            try {
            OºstartSignalº.await();      // ← Wait for driver-thread to be ready.
              doWork();
            BºdoneSignalº.countDown();   // ← Decrease count. 
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
         }

         void doWork() { ... }
       }

       void main() throws InterruptedException {
         CountDownLatch OºstartSignalº=
                          newºCountDownLatch(1);º// ← 1: Gate: Avoid workers to start before
                                                 //       driver-thread is ready.

         CountDownLatch BºdoneSignalº =          // ← N: Make driver thread wait until workers
                          newºCountDownLatch(N);º//      have completed.
                                                 //   Consider alsoºCyclicBarrierº
                                                 //   (reset after count),

         for (int i = 0; i ˂ thread_number ; ++i) {
           new Thread(                           // ← Setup workers in this (driver) thread.
                new Worker(
                    OºstartSignalº,
                    BºdoneSignalº
           )).start();
         }
         ...
       OºstartSignalº.countDown();      // ← Decrease count. count cannot be reset.
         doSomethingElse(); 
       BºdoneSignalº.await();           // ← block until current count reaches zero
                                            Thread is released. Any subsequent invocations
                                            return immediately.
       }
     }

  -  Ex. 2:
     - divide problem into N parts
     - describe each part with a Runnable executing a portion,
     - queue all Runnables to an Executor.
     - When all sub-parts are complete, coordinating-thread will "pass" through await.

     class Driver2 { // ...
       class WorkerRunnable implements Runnable {
         private final CountDownLatch OºdoneSignalº;
         WorkerRunnable(
            CountDownLatch OºdoneSignalº, ...) {
          Oºthis.doneSignal = doneSignalº;
         }

         public void run() {
            try {
              doneSignal.countDown();
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
         }

         void doWork() { ... }
       }
       void main() throws InterruptedException {
         CountDownLatchOºdoneSignalº= new CountDownLatch(N);
         Executor e = ...

         for (int i = 0; i ˂ N; ++i) // create and start threads
           e.execute(new WorkerRunnable(OºdoneSignalº, i));

       OºdoneSignalº.await();           // wait for all to finish

- ˂˂ExecutorService˃˃(Thread Pool) ussage:
  - Alt 1: use an implementation of the interface,
           such as ThreadPoolExecutor or ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.
           an the ˂˂ExecutorService˃˃Instance.execute(/* Runnable */runnableInstance)
           to add a Runnable task to thread pool.
           -  Will execute the task at some time in the
              future in a new thread, in a thread pool, or
              in the calling thread, depending on the implementation
           ˂˂java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService˃˃
           + public     void      shutdown(); // Initiates orderly shutdown of pool
           + public ˂T˃ Future˂T˃ submit(Callable˂T˃ task); // schedule callable task for execution

  - Alt 2: Use factory methods in the 'Executors' class:
          - Write worker thread class implementing ˂˂Runnable˃˃ run()
          Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
          Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int numThreads)
          Executors.newCachedThreadPool(): // ← unbounded pool, with automatic reclamation

REF: @[http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent/java-fork-and-join-forkjoinpool.html]
- java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool  Scheduler is similar to "ExecutorService"
   but ☞<i>Bº"it makes it easy for tasks to recursively split  work into smaller ones"º</i>

- Bulding blocks:
  -ºForkº: Task (=="thread") that "Splits itself" into smaller subtasks,
           executing concurrently.
  
  -ºJoinº: End children tasks (=="threads") and merge results (if any).

         - There is an overhead in forks and maintaing new threads.
           Forking makes sense only for long running tasks with 
           intensive use of CPU
         - Task01, 02, 03 ºwaitº for subtasks to finish execution.

BºCreating new ForkJoinPoolº
  ForkJoinPool BºforkJoinPoolº = new ForkJoinPool(4);

- A Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status),
  and may be used as a CompletionStage, supporting dependent functions and
  actions that trigger upon its completion.
- When two or more threads attempt to complete, completeExceptionally, or
  cancel a CompletableFuture, only one of them succeeds.

ºBarriers (OºallOf*):
  CompletableFuture˂Void˃[] future_list
    = new CompletableFuture[list.size()];
  int idx=0;
  log.info("Connecting plugins ...");
  for (Object el : list) {
    final CompletableFuture˂Void˃
      connectFuture = new CompletableFuture˂˃();
    asyncMethod(connectFuture);
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    The async Method at some moment must call the
    complete()
    ...
  }
  return CompletableFuture. OºallOfº(future_list);

Extracted from:

In asynchronous computation, actions are represented as callbacks, 
handling errors might occur at any step.

- Future: (Java 5+)
  -Represent an asynchronous computation
- CompletableFuture: (Java 8+)
  - Extends Future with methods to combine and handle errors
  - Extends the CompletionStage interface
    - Contract for an asynchronous computation step that
      can be combined with other steps.
  - About 50 different methods for composing, combining, executing 
    async computation

Using CompletableFuture as a Simple Future (no-arg constructor)

In the example below we have a method that creates a 
CompletableFuture instance, then spins off some computation in 
another thread and returns the Future immediately.

  1  public Future˂String˃ calculateAsync() throws InterruptedException {
  2      Future˂String˃ result = new CompletableFuture˂˃();
  3
  4      Executors.newCachedThreadPool().submit(() -˃ {
  5          Thread.sleep(500);
  6          completableFuture.complete("Hello");
  7          return null;
  8      });
  9
  10     return completableFuture;
  11 }
  Line 2: Alternatively when the result of computation is known:
          Future<String> result = CompletableFuture.
             completedFuture("Hello");

  Line 6: Alternatively completableFuture.cancel(false);
  Line 5: any other mechanism can be used to compute


  1 Future<String> completableFuture = calculateAsync();
  2
  3 // ...
  4
  5 String result = completableFuture.get();
  6 assertEquals("Hello", result);

Line 5: get() blocks until .complete("...") is called in other thread
Line 5: get()can raise
           ExecutionException: error during computation
           InterruptedException: thread executing method interrupted

4. CompletableFuture with Encapsulated Computation Logic
   (runAsync -˂˂Runnable˃˃-, supplyAsync -˂˂Supplier˃˃-)

˂˂Supplier˃˃: generic functional interface with single method 
              (zero arguments, returns value)

  1 CompletableFuture˂String˃ future
  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(/* supplier lambda*/ () -˃ "Hello")
  3 .thenApply(/* "processor" lambda */ s -˃ s + " World") // ← returns CompletableFuture
  4 .thenAccept(/* consumer lambda */
  5    s -˃ System.out.println("Computation returned: " + s));
    Line 4: Alternatively (ignrore result)
    .thenRun(/* Runnable lambda*/ () -˃ System.out.println("Computation finished."));

5. Combining Futures (monadic design pattern in functional languages)

  1 CompletableFuture˂String˃ completableFuture
  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "Hello")
  3     .thenCompose(
  4           s -˃ CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ s + " World"));
  4
  5 assertEquals("Hello World", completableFuture.get());

6. Execute two independent Futures and do something with their results

  1 CompletableFuture future
  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "Hello")
  3     .thenCombine(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
  4       () -˃ " World"), (s1, s2) -˃ s1 + s2));
  5
  6 assertEquals("Hello World", future.get());

(Simpler case - nothing to do with resulting value-)
  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "Hello")
  3   .thenAcceptBoth(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
  4      () -˃ " World"), (s1, s2) -˃ log(s1 + s2));

7. Running Multiple Futures in Parallel:
   -  wait for all to execute and process combined results

  1  CompletableFuture˂String˃ future1
  2    = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "Hello");
  3  CompletableFuture˂String˃ future2
  4    = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "Beautiful");
  5  CompletableFuture˂String˃ future3
  6    = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "World");
  7
  8  CompletableFuture˂Void˃ combinedFuture
  9    = CompletableFuture.allOf(future1, future2, future3);
  10
  11 // ...
  12
  13 combinedFuture.get();
  14
  15 String combined = Stream.of(future1, future2, future3)
  16   .map(CompletableFuture::join)
  17   .collect(Collectors.joining(" "));
  18 assertEquals("Hello Beautiful World", combined);

    Line 16: join() is similar to get, but throws unchecked exception 
    if the Future does not complete normally.

8. Handling Errors

   Instead of catching an exception in a syntactic block, the 
CompletableFuture class allows you to handle it in a special handle 
method. This method receives two parameters: a result of a 
computation (if it finished successfully) and the exception thrown 
(if some computation step did not complete normally).



Capture async exception:

  1  CompletableFuture˂String˃ completableFuture
  2    =  CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ {
  3        ... if(errorDetected)
  4               throw new RuntimeException("Computation error!");
  6        return "Hello ";
  7    })}).handle((s, t) -˃ s != null ? s : "Hello, Stranger!");
  8
  9  assertEquals("Hello, Stranger!", completableFuture.get());
Alt:
  1  completableFuture.completeExceptionally(
  2    new RuntimeException("Calculation failed!"));
  3  ...
  4  completableFuture.get(); // ExecutionException

9. Async Methods
 - The methods without the Async postfix run next execution stage 
   using a calling thread.

 - The Async method without the Executor argument runs a step using 
   the common fork/join pool implementation of Executor that is accessed 
   with the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() method.

 - The Async method with an Executor argument runs a step using the 
   passed Executor.

 Ex.: process result of computation with a Function instance
  1 CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture
  2   = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -˃ "Hello");
  3
  4 CompletableFuture<String> future = completableFuture
  5   .thenApplyAsync(s -˃ s + " World");
  6
  7 assertEquals("Hello World", future.get());

    Line 5: under the hood the application of a function is wrapped 
    into a ForkJoinTask instance (for more information on the fork/join 
    framework, see the article ?Guide to the Fork/Join Framework in 
    Java?).  This allows to parallelize your computation even more and 
    use system resources more efficiently.

- Concurrency is a hard problem, but it is significantly simplified by
  working with powerful and simple abstractions. To simplify matters,
  Guava extends the Future interface of the JDK with ListenableFuture.

- """We strongly advise that you always use ListenableFuture instead
  of Future in all of your code, because:
  - Most Futures methods require it.
  - It's easier than changing to ListenableFuture later.
  - Providers of utility methods won't need to provide Future and ListenableFuture

<span xsmall  bgorange>DragonWell JDK with Coroutine Support</span>
REF: @[https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/adoptopenjdk-welcomes-dragonwell/]
- AdoptOpenJDK and Alibaba announced that the Dragonwell JDK will be 
  built, tested, and distributed using AdoptOpenJDK's infrastructure.
  ...  Another interesting feature is the Wisp2 coroutine support.
     BºWips2  maps Java threads to coroutines instead of kernel-level threads:º.
       Many coroutines can be scheduled on a small number of core lines,
       reducing scheduling overhead.
    
     Wisp2 engine is similar in some respects to the aims of Project Loom
     but (unlike Loom) Bºit works out of the box on existing code by enablingº
   Bºit with these Java arguments:º
     $ java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseWisp2
    
    I/O intensive applications where tasks are blocked on events and 
  then scheduled can benefit from the coroutine support. On the other 
  side, RºCPU intensive applications will probably not benefit from º
Rºcoroutines.º

<span TODO xsmall>Loom Project: Ligthweight threads</span>
@[https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/06/19/project-loom-lightweight-java-threads/]
@[https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/353]

-ºMISSION:º
  - make concurrency simple(r) again!

- Threads, provided by Java from its first day, are a convenient concurrency
  construct 
Rºputting aside the separate question of communication among threads
Rºwhich is being supplanted by less convenient abstractions because theirº
Rºcurrent implementation as OS kernel threads is insufficient for meetingº
Rºmodern demands, and wasteful in computing resources that are particularlyº
Rºvaluable in the cloud.º

- Project Loom will introduce BºFIBERS:
  - lightweight, JVM managed, efficient threadsº,
  - A fiber is composed of:
    -Gº1 schedulerº   : Already in place for Java through the excellent scheduler
                      ºForkJoinPoolº
    -Rº1 continuationº: To be implemented in Loom.

  https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/what-are-fibers-and-why-you-should-care/
  ....
  The overhead of fibers is higher but still very low even when 
  compared to async and monadic APIs, which have the disadvantage of 
  introducing a cumbersome, infectious programming style and don’t 
  interoperate with imperative control flow constructs built into a 
  language.
  So aren’t fibers generators or async/awaits?
  
  No, as we have seen fibers are real threads: namely a continuation 
  plus a scheduler. Generators and async/awaits are implemented with 
  continuations (often a more limited form of continuation called 
  stackless, which can only capture a single stack frame), but those 
  continuations don’t have a scheduler, and are therefore not threads.

Ron Pressler discusses and compares the various techniques of dealing with concurrency

- pure functional (monads, affine types)
- imperative      (threads, continuations, monads, async/await)
and shows why delimited continuations are a great fit for the imperative style.

<span xsmall>Spring DONT's!!!</span>
- If a interface has a single implementation and is going
  to be instantiated just once in a single line of code,
  do NOT use Spring dependency injection. 
  - All static compiler safety meassures are lost, translating
    to runtime dangerous checks.
  - Use injection just when you have the intention to allow
    complex interchangable implementations or spring boot
    simplifies code, never when code get more complex and
    unreliable.
  - Ex: A utility class with static methods is preferred to
    an injected spring bean  doing that same functionality.

<span xsmall>IoC Summary</span>
BºBASE PACKAGES of Spring IoC:º
  - org.springframework.beans
    - @[https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-definition]
    - Objects managed by Spring IoC
    - created with the configuration metadata.
    - Represented as ºBeanDefinition objectsº containing:
      - essentially "a recipe for creating one or more objects".
      - package-qualified class name: typically the actual implementation class.
      - behavioral configuration elements: scope, lifecycle callbacks,...)
      - References to other dependencies (or "collaborators")
      - Custom settings (setters).

    BºBest Patternsº
    - Bean metadata need to be registered as early as possible.
      (fail-fast).
    RºWARN:º registration of new beans at runtime (live access to
      factory) is not officially supported and may lead to concurrent
      access exceptions  and/or inconsistent state in the bean container.

  - org.springframework.context.BeanFactory (Interace)
    - provides advanced config.mechanism for "any" type of object.
    └ org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext (Interface)
      - extends BeanFactory with "Enterprise Features"
      - represents the IoC container
      - easier integration with Spring's AOP features
      - message resource handling (for use in i18n)
      - event publication
      - application-layer specific contexts such as
        WebApplicationContext
      └ ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
      · ºApplicationContextº context =
      ·      new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ( // Alt 1:
      ·       "services.xml", "daos.xml");
      ·       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      └ FileSystemApplicationContext
      └ ...

  MyBeanClass myBean = contextº
         .getBeanº("idBeanDef", beanClass.class);

BºSpring History:º
  Spring 1.0+ → Spring 2.5+      → Spring 3.0+
  XML           Annotation-based   Java-based config


BºBean Metadataº
  -ºpackage-qualified class nameº
  -ºname º: (unique) "id" or (aliased) "name" in xml.
  -ºscopeº:
    -ºsingletonº per Spring IoC container (default)
    -ºprototypeº single bean definition to any number of object instances.
    - In web-aware ApplicationContext next scopes are available:
      - ºrequest    º: single bean for lifecycle of HTTP request
      - ºsession    º: single bean for lifecycle of HTTP Session.
      - ºapplicationº: Single bean for lifecycle of ServletContext.
      - ºwebsocketº  : single bean for lifecycle of WebSocket.

  -ºconstructor argsº: (Prefered to properties -setters-):
       ˂bean id="id01" class="x.y.Class01"/˃
       ˂bean id="id02" class="x.y.Class02"/˃

       ˂bean id="instance03" class="x.y.Class03"˃
         ˂constructor-arg ref="id01"/˃                   ← By class
         ˂constructor-arg type="int" value="3320"/˃      ← by type
         ˂constructor-arg name="year" value="2020"/˃     ← by param name
         ˂constructor-arg index="4" value="Hello World"/˃← by param index

       ˂/bean˃
         Note:- Bº˂idref˃ is prefered to property with value attribute (fails-faster)º
              - bean ºdepends-onº attribute can force initialization (and destruction) order

  -ºAutowiringº:
    - Let Spring resolve dependencies("collaborators") of a bean
      by inspecting the contents of the ApplicationContext.
    @[https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-autowire]
      ("ref") autowire values:
      - no     : ref used, not recommended for complex     configs
      - byName : IoC looks for bean with matching name
      - byType : (in setter or constructor args)
                 autowired if exactly one bean of the property type exists in container.
                 throws error if more than one found
               RºWARNª: set to null if zero found.

      ☞ Note: "default-autowire-candidates" attribute in beans tag can limit autowire
              candidate globally with a CSV list of candidates: (*Repository,*Security,*Logging)

  -ºlazy-initº : false: force resolution and instantiate at startup.(default,recomended)
                 true : use for "big objects" to save memory.

  -ºdestroy-methodº
- While weird and not recomeneded, external (to the container) objects can
  be registered like:
  BeanFactory bFactImpl = context.getBeanFactory()
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                 returns DefaultListableBeanFactory impl
  bFactImpl.registerSingleton(..)
  bFactImpl.registerBeanDefinition(..)

BºMethod injectionº
  - Suppose singleton A needs to use ºnon-singletonº bean B
   ºon each method invocation on Aº

  - Alternative A: (RºDiscouraged, tied to Spring internalsº)
    beans A implements ˂˂ApplicationContextAware˃˃.
    getBean("B") to container requesting a
    (typically new) bean B instance.

  - Alternative B: Method Injection
    containers overrides managed bean A
    Limitations:
    - class and method cannot be final
    - lookup methods won't work with factory methods
      and in particular not with @Bean methods in configuration
    - classes, since the container is not in charge of creating the instance
      in that case and therefore cannot create a runtime-generated subclass
      on the fly.

• CONTEXT: 
  2+ APIs running independently have been developed.

  We want toºBOOTSTRAP NEXT THREE MICRO-SERVICESº:

  •ºConfiguration Serverº: centralizes micro-services configuration.
                           (Sort of "etcd" for Spring)
  •ºDiscovery Serverº    : allow apps to find each other
  •ºGateway Serverº      : reverse proxy encapsulating all decoupled
                           micro-services in a single port.

FROM https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33188368/spring-batch-vs-quartz-jobs
Quartz is a scheduling framework. Like "execute something every hour 
or every last friday of the month"

Spring Batch is a framework that defines that "something" that will 
be executed. You can define a job, that consists of steps. Usually a 
step is something that consists of item reader, optional item 
processor and item writer, but you can define a custom stem. You can 
also tell Spring batch to commit on every 10 items and a lot of other 
stuff.  From Spring 2 , it can also schedule tasks
(See also https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352, Batch applications 
  for the Java Platform)

<span xsmall>Reactive (5.0+)</span>
@[https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux]
- Note: Servlet 3.1+ API for non-blocking I/O leads away from
  the rest of the Servlet API where contracts are synchronous
  (Filter, Servlet) or blocking (getParameter, getPart).
- fully non-blocking, handling concurrency with a small number of threads
- supports Reactive Streams non-blocking back pressure:
  In synch/imperative code, blocking calls serve as a natural form
  of back pressure that forces the caller to wait.
  In non-blocking code it becomes important to control the rate
   of events so that a fast producer does not overwhelm its destination.
  Spring Reactive Streams is a small spec, also adopted in Java 9,
  that defines the interaction between asynchronous components
  with back pressure. Ex: a data repository (Publisher),
  produces data that an HTTP server (Subscriber), can then "forward"
  to the response. Main purpose of Reactive Streams is to allow
  the subscriber to control how fast or how slow the publisher
  will produce data.
  If a publisher can’t slow down then it has to decide whether
  to buffer, drop, or fail.
- As a general rule WebFlux APIs accept a plain Publisher as input,
  adapt it to Reactor types internally, use those, and then return
  either Flux or Mono as output.
- runs on Netty, Undertow, Servlet 3.1+ containers
- TODO: WebClient
- TODO: WebTestClient
- TODO: WebSocket
- The spring-web module contains the reactive building block:  
  HTTP abstractions, Reactive Streams server adapters, reactive codecs,
  and a core Web API.
- public spring-web APIs Server support is organized in two layers:
  - HttpHandler and server adapters : the most basic, common API for HTTP
    request handling with Reactive Streams back pressure running on different
    servers.
  - WebHandler API : slightly higher level but still general purpose server
    web API with exception handlers (WebExceptionHandler), filters (WebFilter),
    and a target handler (WebHandler)
    All components work on ServerWebExchange — a container for the HTTP
    request and response that also adds request attributes, session attributes,
    access to form data, multipart data, and more.
- Codecs: The spring-web module provides
  HttpMessageReader(DecoderHttpMessageReader) and
  HttpMessageWriter(EncoderHttpMessageWriter) for encoding and decoding the
  HTTP request and response body with Reactive Streams.
  Basic Encoder and Decoder implementations exist in spring-core but
  spring-web adds more for JSON, XML, and other formats.

BºDispatcherHandlerº:
- central controller
- discovers delegate components from Spring configuration
  If declared with the bean name "webHandler" it is in turn
  discovered by WebHttpHandlerBuilder which puts together a
  request processing chain as described in WebHandler API
- typical WebFlux application Spring configuration:
  - DispatcherHandler named "webHandler"
  - WebFilters
  - WebExceptionHandlers
  - DispatcherHandler special beans
  - Others
- The configuration is given to WebHttpHandlerBuilder to
  build the processing chain:
 (The resulting HttpHandler is ready for use with a server adapter)
  ApplicationContext context = ...
  HttpHandler handler = WebHttpHandlerBuilder.
      applicationContext(context);
- "special beans":  Spring-managed instances implementing one of the contracts listed:

  Bean type            | Explanation
  ---------------------+------------------------------------
  HandlerMapping       | Map a request to a handler.
                       | mapping is based on some criteria
                       | the details of which vary by
                       | HandlerMapping implementation 
                       | (annotated controllers,
                       | simple URL pattern mappings,...)
  ---------------------+------------------------------------
  HandlerAdapter       | Helps the DispatcherHandler to
                       | invoke a handler mapped to a
                       | request regardless of how the
                       | handler is actually invoked.
                       | For example invoking an annotated
                       | controller requires resolving
                       | various annotations. The main
                       | purpose of a HandlerAdapter
                       | is to shield the DispatcherHandler
                       | from such details.
  ---------------------+------------------------------------
  HandlerResultHandler | Process the HandlerResult returned
                       | from a HandlerAdapter

- request flow:
  for map in HandlerMapping_list:
    //  (continue is map doesn't match request)
    handler = first handler in map matching request
    HandlerResult res = handler()
    HandlerResultHandler(res)

  Rules
  1) Each HandlerMapping is asked to find a
     matching handler and the first match is used
  2) If a handler is found, it is executed through
     an appropriate HandlerAdapter which exposes
     the return value from the execution as
     HandlerResult.
  3) The HandlerResult is given to an appropriate
     HandlerResultHandler to complete processing
     by writing to the response directly or using
     a view to render.

BºProcessing Chainº
- The processing chain can be put together with WebHttpHandlerBuilder which builds an
HttpHandler that in turn can be run with a server adapter.
To use the builder either add components individually or point to an ApplicationContext
to have the following detected:

REF:
@[https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/GraalVM-native-image-support]
Working toward GraalVM native image support without requiring additional
configuration or workaround is one of the themes of upcoming Spring Framework
5.3. The main missing piece for considering GraalVM as a suitable deployment
target for Spring applications is providing custom GraalVM Feature
implementation at Spring Framework level to automatically register classes
used in the dependency mechanism or Spring factories, see the related issue #
22968 for more details.

<span xsmall>Labmdas Intro</span>
- addition of lambda expressions in Java 8 provides for functional APIs in Java
  and simplifies development of non-blocking style APIs
  (low-level CompletableFuture or higher level ReactiveX).

  The conventional computing model of a Touring machine takes for granted
  that data is already available to be processed.

  In the Internet era, data is arriving at random and we don't want to block
  our CPU in an infinite loop waiting for such data to arrive.

  The conventional approach is to let the OS scheduler to divide the CPU
  into threads or processes sharing the hardware at defined intervals.
  While this approach works well for standard load scenarios, it fails for
  "moderm" workloads with thousands or tens of thousands of simultaneous
  clients accessing the server. Each new OS thread requires some extra
  memory on the OS kernel (about 2Kilobytes per Thread, and even more
  per Process). Switching from thread to thread or process to process becomes
  expensive or prohibitive with that number of concurent I/O flows.
  This is even worse when our server is virtualized with many other
  competing VMs running on the same physical server.

  Async programming will try to reause the same thread by many different
  clients or flows of I/O data providing a much better ussage of hardware
  resources and avoiding unnecesary context-switches between threads or
  processes.

  The term "reactive" refers to programming models that are built around
  reacting to change — network component reacting to I/O events, UI controller
  reacting to mouse events, etc. In that sense non-blocking is reactive because
  instead of being blocked we are now in the mode of reacting to notifications
  as operations complete or data becomes available.

  Spring Reactive Streams is a small spec, also adopted in Java 9, that defines
  the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure. For
  example a data repository — acting as Publisher, can produce data that an
  HTTP server — acting as Subscriber, can then write to the response. The main
  purpose of Reactive Streams is to allow the subscriber to control how fast or
  how slow the publisher will produce data.

  Reactive Streams is of interest to low-level reusable libraries but
  no final applications are better suites using a higher level and richer
  (functional) API like Java8+ Collection-Stream API or more ingeneral APIs
  like those provided by ReactiveRX.

  Reactive programming can also be compared with the way data flows in Unix
  pipelines when handling text files. In the next Unix command there is a
  file input (it can be a real file in the hard-disk or a socket receiving
  data) and the different commands in the pipe consume STDIN and result to
  STDOUT for further processing.
  $ cat input.csv | grep "...." | sort | uniq | ... ˃  output.csv
  Reactive Java frameworks are ussually much fasters since everything executes
  on the same process (a Unix pipeline requires the help of the underlying
  OS to work), and the type of input/output data can be any sort of Java
  object (not just file text).

<span xsmall>java.util.concurrent.Flow(1.9+)</span>
@[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html]
- JDK 1.9+
- Reactive Streams was adopted by the JDK in the form of the java.util.concurrent.Flow API.
- It allows two different libraries that support asynchronous streaming to connect to each other,
    with well specified semantics about how each should behave, so that backpressure, completion, cancellation
    and error handling is predictably propagated between the two libraries.
- There is a rich ecosystem of open source libraries that support Reactive Streams,
    and since its inclusion in JDK9, there are a few in development implementations that are
    targetting the JDK, including the incubating <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/321">JDK9 HTTP Client</a>,
    and the <a href="https://twitter.com/brunoborges/status/915302682939711488">Asynchronous Database Adapter (ADBA)</a>

By default, Observables execute work on the immediate thread,
which is the thread that declared the Observer and subscribed it.
Not all Observables will fire on the immediate thread, (Observable.interval(),...)

BºCold/Hot Observablesº
  └ Cold: - Repeat the same content to different observers.
          - Represent sort-of inmmutable data.
          - A "cold" Observable waits until an observer subscribes to it
            an observer is guaranteed to see the whole sequence of events
  └ Hot : "Broadcast" to all observers at the same time.
          - A "hot" Observable may begin emitting items as soon as it is created.
          - An observer connecting "later" will loose old emissions.
          - Representºreal-time eventsº. They are time-sensitive.
          - Emissions will start when first observers calls connect().
          - a cold/hot observable can generate a new hot observable by
            calling publish() that will return a hot ConnectableObservable.
            Helpful to avoid the replay of data on each subscrived Observer.
  
          - NOTE: A "Connectable" Observable: does NOT begin emitting items
              until its Connect method is called, whether or not any observers
              have subscribed to it.

"""Why Reactor when there's already RxJava2?
   RxJava2 is java 6 while for Reactor the Spring team decided to go all in

   and fancy Java 8 features.

   If you are going to use Spring 5, Reactor might be the better option.

By default Vert.x attaches CPU-core-thread 1˂--˃2 event loops
VertX Threading Strategies:
   Incoming network data -˃ accepting thread"N":
   accepting thread "N" -˃ event-loop thread: +event with data

When a verticle opens a network server and is deployed more than once,
then the events are being distributed to the verticle instances in a
round-robin fashion which is very useful for maximizing CPU usage with
lots of concurrent networked requests.

Tip: The SQL database modules supported by the Vert.x project do not currently
   offer anything beyond passing SQL queries (e.g., an object-relational mapper)
   as they focus on providing asynchronous access to databases.
   However, nothing forbids using more advanced modules from the community,
   and we especially recommend checking out projects like this jOOq generator
   for VertX

<span xsmall>JavaLite</span>
- lightweight system for processing asynchronous jobs. 
- Use Cases:
  - website that needs to run batch process in background
  - We receive batch of inputs to be processed in a "best-effort"
    but replay as-soon-as-possible to client that we have the
    input batch ready for processing.

- easy-to-use "Wrapper" on top o Apache Artemis (ActiveMQ "next Gen")
  the Async adds an abstraction layer based on a Command Pattern,
  which makes it trivial to add asynchronous processing.

- Embedded broker instance with reasonable defaults

- Ex:
  Asyncºasyncº= new Async(            ←BºCREATE one or more Queuesº
            "/opt/project1",          ← place to store persistent messages
            false,
            new QueueConfig(
               "MESSAGES_QUEUE",      ← queue 1 name
               new CommandListener(), 
               5)                     ← number of listeners(threads) to
            ,
            new QueueConfig(
                  "ERRORS_QUEUE",     ← queue 2 name (No limit in the number o 
                  new ErrorListener(),                queues)
               5)
            );
       ºasyncº.start();

   public class HelloCommand             ←BºCreate a commandº
       extends Command {
       private String message;
   
       public HelloCommand(String message) {
         this.message = message;
       }
   
       public HelloCommand() {}          ← Rºnecessary (forbid finals)º
   
       @Override
       public void execute() {
           System.out.println(message);
       }
   }


   for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){         ←Bºsending commands asyncº
      async.send(
        "MESSAGES_QUEUE",
        new HelloCommand("Hello Number "+ i));
   }
   Output will be similar to
   → Hello Number 0
   → Hello Number 1
   → ...

   List<Command> topCommands             ←BºPeek (vs Consume) 3 "top"º
      = ºasyncº.getTopCommands(            commands from "ERROR_QUEUE"
           3, "ERROR_QUEUE"); 


- Commands can be read and processed synchronously (one-by-one)
  from an individual queue one at the time without a listener.
  Ex: Qºyou do not want to process errors automaticallyº. To do so:

  ErrorCommand errorCommand =           ←BºConsume messageº
       (ErrorCommand)receiveCommand("ERROR_QUEUE");
  ... // Process manually

BºText vs Binary messagesº
  - To be compatible with JMS the  communication protocol is limited t
    - javax.jms.TextMessage   ← Default mode.
    - javax.jms.BytesMessage  ← async.setBinaryMode(true);

    In both cases, the Rºserialization of a command is first done to XMLº
    with the use of XStream.
  - If a given command has transient field that must NOT  be serialized,
    use the field annotation @XStreamOmitField to ignore it.

  -RºWARN:º Do not switch from mode to mode while having persistent 
            messages stored in your queues.

BºCommands with DB accessº
  - If queue processing requires a database connetion, DBCommandListener
    can be used:
    Async async = new Async(filePath, false, new 
        QueueConfig("MESSAGES_QUEUE", new 
        DBCommandListener(                 ← If JNDI connection is setup, the 
         "java:comp/env/jdbc/conn01"), 5)    listener will find and open it
   );                                        Use your tomcat/Jboss/... container
                                             documentation to set up it properly
    
Bº(Artemis) Config APIº
  - For complex app configuration, the underlying Artemis API
    can be used:
    org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.config.Condifuration 
       artemisCOnfig = async.getConfig();

- See also filequeue in this map. It's faster but doesn't support
  Queue to DDBBs.

<span xsmall>FileQueue</span>
@[https://github.com/stimulussoft/filequeue]
- KISS alternative using MVStore
@[http://www.h2database.com/html/mvstore.html]
- All producers and consumers run within a JVM.
- H2 MVStore DB used for storage.
- Queue items are BºPOJOs serialized into Json using jacksonº.
-Gºfaster than JavaLite due to performance shortcutº:
  -BºFile Queue will transfer queued items directly to consumersº
   Bºwithout hitting the database provided there are consumers  º
   Bºavailable, otherwise, message will be persistedº
-RºDoesn't support persistence to JNDI DDBBº
- fixed and exponential back-off retry is present.

BºPRE-SETUPº:
  - maven/gradle package dependency:
    com.stimulussoft:filequeue:1.1.4

BºUsageº:
  - Implement POJO extending FileQueueItem
  - Implement consume(FileQueueItem) on ˂˂Consumer˃˃ to process items
  - Instantiate a FileQueue object and call config() to configure
  - Call startQueue() to start the queue
  - Call stopQueue() to stop the queue processing
  - Call FileQueue.destroy() to shutdown all static threads (optional)

BºExample Implementation:º
  └ Queue Ussage example:
    FileQueue queue = FileQueue.fileQueue();
    FileQueue.Config config = FileQueue.
        config(
          queueName,
          queuePath,
          TestFileQueueItem.class,
          new TestConsumer()
        )
        .maxQueueSize(MAXQUEUESIZE)           // ← queueItem will block until an slot becomes 
                                                   available or ExceptionTimeout thrown
        .retryDelayAlgorithm(
           QueueProcessor.RetryDelayAlgorithm.EXPONENTIAL)
        .retryDelay(RETRYDELAY)
        .maxRetryDelay(MAXRETRYDELAY)
        .maxRetries(0);                       // ← Infinite retries
        .persistRetryDelay(                   // ← delay between DDBB scans.
           PERSISTENTRETRYDELAY);
    queue.startQueue(config);                 // ← Start queue
    for (int i = 0; i < ROUNDS; i++)
      queue.queueItem(                        // ← Submit items
        new TestFileQueueItem(i)
      );
    queue.stopQueue();                        // ← stopQueue

  └ Consumer implementation:
    static class TestConsumer implements Consumer<FileQueueItem> {
    
        public TestConsumer() { }
    
        @Override
        public Result consume(FileQueueItem item) 
        throws InterruptedException {
                        try {
        TestFileQueueItem retryFileQueueItem = 
            (TestFileQueueItem) item;
        if (retryFileQueueItem.getTryCount() == RETRIES )
            return Result.SUCCESS;
        return Result.FAIL_REQUEUE;
                        } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error(e.getMessage(), e);
        return Result.FAIL_NOQUEUE;
                        }
        }
    }

  └ FileQueueItem implementation:

    import com.stimulussoft.filequeue.*;
    
    static class TestFileQueueItem extends FileQueueItem {
      Integer id;
      public TestFileQueueItem() { super(); };
      private TestFileQueueItem(Integer id) {
          this.id = id;
      }
      @Override
      public String toString() { return String.valueOf(id); }
      public Integer getId() { return id; }
      public void setId(Integer id) { this.id = id; }
    }

  └ File Caching:
    - If there is the need to cache a file to disk or perform resource 
      availability checks prior to items being placed on the queue, 
      implement availableSlot() on the QueueCallback interface. This method 
      is called as soon as a slot becomes available, just before the item 
      is place on the queue. It may be used to cache a file to disk, or 
      perform resource availability pre-checks (e.g. disk space check).

-ºProperty File Checker!!!!º RºTODOº
  -ºIt ensures that used keys are found in the corresponding º
   ºproperty file or resource bundle.º

-ºGUI Effect Checkerº
  - It is difficult for a programmer to remember
    which methods may be called on which thread(s).
    (Main GUI thread or others)
   Checker types the method as if:
   - It accesses no UI elements (and may run on any thread);
   - It may access UI elements  (and must run on the UI thread)

<span xsmall>JBehave</span>
 JBehave is a framework for Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). BDD 
is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test 
driven design, and is intended to make these practices more 
accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike. It shifts 
the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and 
positions itself as a design philosophy.

BºGOALº
- unit of work.
- A goal accepts configuration properties (parameters) to customize
its run-time behavior
- Ex: Compiler:compile defines a set of parameters to specify target
JDK version or switching on/off compiler optimizations
- An ºordered listº of goals can be attached to a Bºlifecycle phaseº.
Ex:
                             Executes next goals in order
mvn Bºpackageº  | resources:resources →
  ^Lifecicle  | compiler:compile →
              | resources:testResources →
              | compiler:testCompile →
              | surefire:test jar:jar

BºSNAPSHOTSº
Q: What exactly is a Maven Snapshot and why do we need it?
A:☞A snapshot version is one that has not been released (Oºfuture releaseº).
 The idea is that ºbeforeº a "1.0" release is done, there exists
 a 1.0Oº-SNAPSHOTº. That version is what might become 1.0. It's
 basically Oº"1.0 under development"º. This might be close to a real
 1.0 release, or pretty far (right after the 0.9 release, for ex.)

 The difference between a "real" version and a snapshot version is
 that ºsnapshots might get updatesº.  That means that downloading
 1.0-SNAPSHOT today might give a different file than downloading it
 yesterday or tomorrow.
 In contrast OºReleased versions are inmutablesº:
 updates to "1.0.0" requires new version "1.0.1".

 Snapshot dependencies should only exist during development.
ºReleased versions (i.e. no non-snapshot) should NEVER have aº
ºdependency on snapshotsº

<span xsmall>Reactor(POM aggregate vs inherit)</span>
Maven supports both project inheritance (set a parent project) and aggregation (reactor mechanism).

MVN reactor allows to execute a goal (build,...) over a set of projects.
The reactor will determine the build order according to defined dependencies on each pom.
MVN 2 improved reactor making it transparent to users. Anyway a plugin exists to customize the interaction
with the reactor: maven-reactor-plugin

If we launch compilation in a multi-module (like AbsisParentPom) and something goes wrong, we can always
re-start from the last failed module with the '--resume-from' option like:
$ mvn --resume-from=com.myCompany.myModule:MyArtifact clean install -P myProfile -DskipTests=true
</pre>

<pre zoom  labels="maven,tool,devops,qa" >
<span xsmall>Dependency Management</span>
<span xsmall>mvn dependency:analyze</span>
list two things:
Dependencies used but not declared.
If found in the parent pom, there is no
problem when compiling, but must be
included at runtime on the server.

Dependencies declared but not used for
the scope provided (compile, provided…).
They can be in the parent pom too.
Noneless, can be needed at runtime.

<span xsmall>POM BEST PRACTICES:</span>
  REF: @[http://geertschuring.wordpress.com/2011/02/23/maven-best-practices/]

- update pom dependency to latest version
  Ex. Update org.checkerframework.*:
$º$ mvn versions:use-latest-versions -Dincludes="org.checkerframework:*"º

- Replace references like ${artifactId} or ${pom.artifactId} with new
  º${project.artifactId}ºsyntax. This syntax follows the XML document
  structure, making it easy to remember and predict the value that the
  reference will result in.

- Try to avoid using inherited properties. Developers can easily forget
  that a certain property is used by a child POM and change the value
  breaking the build in an unexpected place. Secondly, its quite annoying
  not to be able to easily lookup a property without having to find
  and examine the parent POM.

- Use the dependency management section of the parent pom to define
  all dependency versions, but do not set a scope here so that all
  dependencies have scope compile by default.

- Use properties to define the dependency versions. This way you can
  get an overview of all versions quickly.

- Use the pluginmanagement section of parent pom to define versions for
  ºallº plugins that your build uses, even standard maven plugins like
  maven-compile-plugin and maven-source-plugin. This way your build will
  not suddenly behave differently when a new version of a plugin is released.

- When using a parent POM not located in the directory directly above
  the current POM define an empty relativePath element in your parent section.

- Use the dependency plugin to check your project for both unnecessary
  dependencies and undeclared-but-used-none-the-less dependencies.
  The goal is called ‘analyze’:
$º$ mvn dependency:analyze  º

- Make sure the pom files contain all the repository references needed
  to download all dependencies. If you want to use a local repository
  instead of downloadin strait from the internet then use the maven
  settings file to define mirrors for the individual repositories that
  are defined in the poms.

- If you use Nexus, then do not create repository groups containing both
  hosted and proxied repositories. This will dramaticly reduce the
  responsiveness because Nexus will check the remote locations of the
  proxied repositories even if a hosted repository contains the requested
  artifact.

<span xsmall>Test settings</span>
@[https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#test-your-settings]
- Make sure there are ºno dependencies on snapshotsº in the POMs to be released.
However, the project you want to stage must be a SNAPSHOT version
- Check that your POMs will not lose content when they are rewritten
during the release process:
- Verify that all pom.xml files have an SCM definition
- Do a dryRun release: Oºmvn release:prepare -DdryRun=trueº
Postcript: You may also wish to pass Oº-DautoVersionSubmodules=trueº
as this will save you time if your project is multi-moduled.
- Diff the original file pom.xml with the one called pom.xml.tag to
see if the license or any other info has been removed. This has been known
to happen if the starting ˂project˃ tag is ºNOTº on a single
line. The only things that should be different between these files are the
˂version˃ and ˂scm˃ elements. Any other changes you must
backport yourself to the original pom.xml file and commit before
proceeding with the release.

Utilities to clean, organize, and restructure Maven POMs.

BºPOM Cleanerº:
  "Cleans up" a single POM, normalizing plugin and dependency specifications,
  converting hardcoded versions to properties, consitently ordering top-level
  elements, and pretty-printing the output.
  There is also a version of this tool that runs as a web-app.

BºVersion Updater:º
  Updates the version for a set of POMs, either to a specified version or the
  next sequential version.

BºDependency Check:º
  Examines a project to find dependencies that are specified but unused, and
  those that are used but unspecified (ie, transitive dependencies that
  should be direct).

BºMVND(aemon)º    [performance][TODO]
@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/mvnd-mavens-speed-daemon/]
- Study driven by Gradle shows Maven as being 
Rºup to 100 times slower than gradle buildsº. 
- JIT compiled classes are cached.
- multi process if needed.

- pretty small: ~4060 lines of Java code.

- mvnd speed gains:   
  - 1/2 modules: ~ x7/x10 faster
  - big projects: ~ x6 faster

Docker+mvn/gradle integration:
@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/08/jib]
@[https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib]

- Build Java Container without Docker/Dockerfile
- Jib's build approach separates the Java application
  into multiple layers, so when there are any code changes,
  only those changes are rebuilt, rather than the entire application.
- these layers are layered on top of a distroless base image.
  containing only the developer's application and its runtime deps.

- ºDocker build flow º
        │JAR│ ← (build) ← │Project│
          │                                                              │Container │

     │Dockerfile│

  ºJib Build Flow:º
                                                                         │Container │

- Ex: Creating images from command line:   
  Once jib is installed and added to PATH, to create a new image do something like:
$º$ /opt/jib/bin/jib                         º
$º  --insecure \                             º  ← allow conn. to HTTP (non TLS) dev.registries
$º  build \                                  º  ← build image
$º  --registry \                             º  ← Push to registry
$º    gcr.io/distroless/java \               º  ← Base image (busybox, nginx, gcr.io/distroless/java,...)
$º    192.168.1.3:5000/jib:latest \          º  ← Destination registry / image

- invokes with a declared version of Gradle.

- Workflow:
- set up a new Gradle project
- add Wrapper to new project
  (a gradle runtime must be instaled)
  $ gradle wrapper \

Bº##########º
• PRESETUP: The target database to manage and user with update privileges be created first,
            "outside" of flyway. 

• Database changee are called aºMigrationsº. They can be: 
  · Versioned  migrations: identified by a version number, applied in order exactly once.
                           An optional revert migration version can be provided to roolback
                           changes in case of error.
  · Repeatable migrations:  

• Flyway used anºinternal flyway_schema_history ddbb to keep track of migrations appliedº.

• SQL and JAVA  migrations in src/main/resources/db/migration/ are automatically      [spring]
  applied in Spring Boot when  'org.flywaydb:flyway-core' compile dependency is
  detected.

<span xsmall>c3p0</span>
@[https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#what_is]

c3p0 is an easy-to-use library for making traditional JDBC drivers
"enterprise-ready" by augmenting them with functionality defined by the jdbc3
spec and the optional extensions to jdbc2. As of version 0.9.5, c3p0 fully
supports the jdbc4 spec.

In particular, c3p0 provides several useful services:

- A class whichs adapt traditional DriverManager-based JDBC drivers to the
  newer javax.sql.DataSource scheme for acquiring database Connections.
- Transparent pooling of Connection and PreparedStatements behind DataSources
  which can "wrap" around traditional drivers or arbitrary unpooled DataSources.

The library tries hard to get the details right:
- c3p0 DataSources are both Referenceable and Serializable, and are thus
  suitable for binding to a wide-variety of JNDI-based naming services.
- Statement and ResultSets are carefully cleaned up when pooled Connections
  and Statements are checked in, to prevent resource- exhaustion when clients use
  the lazy but common resource-management strategy of only cleaning up their
  Connections. (Don't be naughty.)
- The library adopts the approach defined by the JDBC 2 and 3 specification
  (even where these conflict with the library author's preferences). DataSources
  are written in the JavaBean style, offering all the required and most of the
  optional properties (as well as some non-standard ones), and no-arg
  constructors. All JDBC-defined internal interfaces are implemented
  (ConnectionPoolDataSource, PooledConnection, ConnectionEvent-generating
  Connections, etc.) You can mix c3p0 classes with compliant third-party
  implementations (although not all c3p0 features will work with external
  implementations of ConnectionPoolDataSource).

- REF:JSON processing public review
  @[https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/json-processing-public-review]

Public review of JSR 374:
- Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P) version 1.1 is now open.
  This version is expected to be included in the release of J2EE 8 
  and keeps JSON-P current with JSON IETF standards. It includes 
  support for:
    - JSON Pointer
    - JSON Patch
    - JSON Merge Patch
    - Query and transformation operations
    - Java 8 streams and lambdas
- JSON-P was introduced in 2013 with the release of J2EE 7, as
  an alternative to Gson and Jackson. It was designed to parse, generate,
  and query standard JSON documents.
  SR-367: Java API for JSON Binding (JSON-B), will also be included in the 
  release of J2EE 8.

<span xsmall>BDD Serenity Testing</span>
@[https://serenity-bdd.github.io/theserenitybook/latest/index.html]

- Serenity BDD is an open source library that aims to make the idea of living
  documentation a reality.

- write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and 
  regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results to 
  produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe 
  what your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not 
  only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what 
  requirements have been tested.

- One key advantage of using Serenity BDD is that you do not have to invest time
  in building and maintaining your own automation framework.

- Serenity BDD provides strong support for different types of automated acceptance testing, including:
  - Rich built-in support for web testing with Selenium.
  - REST API testing with RestAssured.
  - Highly readable, maintainable and scalable automated testing with the
    Screenplay pattern.

- The aim of Serenity is to make it easy to quickly write well-structured,
  maintainable automated acceptance criteria, using your favourite BDD or
  conventional testing library. You can work with Behaviour-Driven-Development
  tools like Cucumber or JBehave, or simply use JUnit. You can integrate with
  requirements stored in an external source (such as JIRA or any other test cases
  management tool), or just use a simple directory-based approach to organise
  your requirements.

- framework for Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). BDD is an 
  evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven 
  design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and 
  intuitive to newcomers and experts alike. It shifts the vocabulary 
  from being test-based to behaviour-based, and positions itself as a 
  design philosophy.

º"native-image"º utility:
 - ahead-of-time compiler to a Bºstandalone executableº.
 - JVM is replaced with necesary  components (memory mngr,
   Thread scheduler) in "Substrate VM" runtime:
   Substrate VM runtime is actually the name for the runtime components
   (like the deoptimizer, garbage collector, thread scheduling etc.).
 - Result has faster startup time and lower runtime memory .
 - It statically analyses which classes and methods are reachable
   and used during application execution and passes all this
   reachable code as the input to the GraalVM compiler for
   ahead-of-time compilation into native-library.

- MicroProfile specifies a collection of Java EE APIs and technologies which together
  form a core baseline microservice that aims to deliver application portability across multiple runtimes.

- MicroProfile 1.0 spec includes a subset of the 30+ Java Enterprise specifications:
  - JAX-RS 2.0 for RESTful endpoints
  - CDI 1.1 for extensions and dependency injection
  - JSON-P 1.0 for processing JSON messages.

- MicroProfile 1.2  (September 2017) include:
  - Configuration 1.1
  - Fault Tolerance
  - JWT
  - Metrics
  - Health Check

- MicroProfile 2.0 (Future). It is expected it will align all APIs to Java EE 8.

- vendors runtime support:
  - WebSphere Liberty IBM
  - TomEE from Tomitribe
  - Payara
  - RedHat's WildFly Swarm
  - KumuluzEE.

- Community support:
  - London Java Community
  - SOUJava

SmallRye Mutiny is a reactive programming library. Wait? Another one?  Yes!

Mutiny is designed after having experienced many issues with other 
Reactive programming libraries and having seen many developers lost 
in an endless sequence of flatMap. Mutiny takes a different approach. 
First, Mutiny does not provide as many operators as the other famous 
libraries, focusing instead on the most used operators. Furthermore, 
Mutiny provides a more guided API, which avoids having classes with 
hundreds of methods that cause trouble for even the smartest IDE. 
Finally, Mutiny has built-in converters from and to other reactive 
programing libraries, so you can always pivot.

SwarmCache is a simple but effective distributed cache. It uses IP 
multicast to efficiently communicate with any number of hosts on a 
LAN. It is specifically designed for use by clustered, 
database-driven web applications. Such applications typically have 
many more read operations than write operations, which allows 
SwarmCache to deliver the greatest performance gains. SwarmCache uses 
JavaGroups internally to manage the membership and communications of 
its distributed cache.

Wrappers have been written that allow SwarmCache to be used with the 
Hibernate and JPOX persistence engines.

You use the jhsdb tool to attach to a Java process or to a core dump 
from a crashed Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

jhsdb is a Serviceability Agent (SA) tool. Serviceability Agent (SA) 
is a JDK component used to provide snapshot debugging, performance 
analysis and to get an in-depth understanding of the Hotspot JVM and 
the Java application executed by the Hotspot JVM.

Even though native debuggers like gdb are available for examining the 
JVM, unlike jhsdb, these native debuggers do not have an inbuilt 
understanding of the data structures in Hotspot and hence, are not 
able to throw insights on the Java application being executed. jhsdb 
knows about the locations and address ranges of crucial components of 
the JVM like the Java heap, heap generations, regions, code cache, 
etc.

<span xsmall>GraalVM Native Image</span>
@[https://jamesward.com/2020/05/07/graalvm-native-image-tips-tricks/]

| FROM oracle/graalvm-ce:20.0.0-java11 as builder
| WORKDIR /app
| COPY . /app
| 
| RUN gu install native-image
| 
| # Build the app (via Maven, Gradle, etc) and create the native image
| FROM scratch
| COPY --from=builder /app/target/my-native-image /my-native-image
| ENTRYPOINT ["/my-native-image"]

- to build a statically linked native image:
  --static
  
  ...Luckily GraalVM has a way to also include the necessary system
  libraries in the static native image with musl libc:
  - In your Dockerfile download the musl bundle for GraalVM:
  
| RUN curl -L -o musl.tar.gz \
|     https://github.com/gradinac/musl-bundle-example/releases/download/v1.0/musl.tar.gz ⅋⅋ \
|     tar -xvzf musl.tar.gz
  
  And then add a native-image parameter that points to the extracted location of the bundle, like:
  
  -H:UseMuslC=bundle/
  
  Now your native image will include the standard library system calls that are needed!

- If AOT thing fails, it will fallback to just running the app in the JVM.
  To avoid it running on the JVM: 
  --no-fallback

- FAIL-FAST: Don't Defer Problems to Runtime
  - make sure native-image is NOT being run with any of these params:
    --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime
    --allow-incomplete-classpath
    -H:+ReportUnsupportedElementsAtRuntime

- Reflection Woes:
  - reflection happens at runtime, making it hard for an AOT complier.
  - you can tell GraalVM about what needs reflection access,
    but this can quickly get a bit out-of-hand, hard to derive and maintain.
  - Micronaut and Quarkus do a pretty good job generating the reflection
    configuration at compile time but you might need to augment the
    generated config. (tricky with shaded transitive dependencies).

  - To reliably generate a reflection config you need to exercise as many
    execution code paths as possible, ideally by running unit/integration tests.
  - GraalVM has a way to keep track of reflection and output the configuration.
    - Run the app on GraalVM and use a special Java agent that will be able to
      see the reflective calls.
    STEPS:
      - grab GraalVM Community Edition:
      - set JAVA_HOME and PATH.
      - from release assets grab the right native-image-installable-svm-BLAH.jar file
        and extract it in the root of your GraalVM JAVA_HOME directory.
      - run tests with parameter:
        -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=src/graal"
        (This will generate the reflection config (and possibly other configs for
         dynamic proxies, etc).
      - tell native-image about those configs, like:
        -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=src/graal/reflect-config.json

   - For Quarkus ⅋ Micronaut see their docs (Quarkus / Micronaut) for details on
     how to add your own reflection config files.

Java classes in the example project

example project contains three Java classes:
- ExampleInitializer: replaces standard WEB-INF/web.xml

  -  register Spring's DispatcherServlet without any 
     additional XML configuration:

     final AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext context
            = new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
     context.register(ExampleConfiguration.class);
     context.setServletContext(servletContext);
     final ServletRegistration.Dynamic dsr
            = servletContext.addServlet("dispatcher",
              new DispatcherServlet(context));
     dsr.setLoadOnStartup(1);
     dsr.addMapping("/");

  - ExampleConfiguration: Spring-specific config enabling Spring MVC.

  - ExampleResource: standard Spring @RestController.

- Deploy to Kubernetes:

    $ mvn clean package    ← generate war in target/
    $ mvn k8s:build        ← Build docker image  (webapp/example:latest)
                             (Using jkube/jkube-tomcat9-binary-s2i by default)
                             Alternatives like Jetty can be used

    $ mvn k8s:resource     ← create required cluster config resource manifests 
    $ mvn k8s:apply        ← apply to kubectl– configured cluster
 
    $ kubectl get pod      ← Verify that app is running

  - memory allocation, 
  - database IO
  - number of executed SQL statements
  - ...

- JfrUnit provide means of identifying and analysizing such issues in 
  a reliable, environment independent way in standard JUnit tests,

<span xsmall>Obevo: DDBB change manager</span>
- (Goldman Sachs)
  Obevo is a database deployment tool that helps teams manage database 
  changes in their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. In 
  addition to handling production deployments, Obevo aids the 
  development phase by defining a clean structure to maintain DB object 
  code, and helps the testing phase with features such as in-memory 
  database conversion. Notably, Obevo was designed for systems of 
  enterprise scale and complexity and can manage hundreds of DB objects 
  in a schema, while still handling new schemas in a simple manner. 
  “We feel our ability to onboard a large and long-lived system to a 
  clean SDLC process is a key differentiator in the open source 
  space,” said Shant, a vice president in the Technology Division. 
  “By publishing this to the open source community, we hope to aid 
  others in their own DB deployment estates while growing a strong 
  community around the tool.”

  a table format that Tablasco understands. “Every test produces a 
  color-coded HTML break report, which helps users quickly identify the 
  issue,” said Barry, a vice president in the Technology Division. 
  Furthermore, Tablasco features automated baseline management,

<span xsmall>Java Class Library (JCL, rt.jar)</span>
rt.jar contains the Java Class Library (JCL)</span>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Class_Library

- The Java Class Library (JCL) is a set of dynamically loadable 
  libraries that Java applications can call at run time. Because the 
  Java Platform is not dependent on a specific operating system, 
  applications cannot rely on any of the platform-native libraries. 
  Instead, the Java Platform provides a comprehensive set of standard 
  class libraries, containing the functions common to modern operating 
  systems.
  
- Java Class Library (JCL) is almost entirely written in Java, except 
  for the parts that need direct access to the hardware and operating 
  system (such as for I/O or bitmap graphics). The classes that give 
  access to these functions commonly use Java Native Interface wrappers 
  to access operating system APIs.
  
- The Java Class Library (rt.jar) is located in the default bootstrap 
  classpath[1] and does not have to appear in the classpath declared 
  for the application. The runtime uses the bootstrap class loader to 
  find the JCL.

BºThe Java Module System (part of the Java 9 release) broke the º
Bºmonolithic "rt.jar" JAR file and modularized the JCL itself inº
Bºseveral modules with specified dependencies.º

Use a command-line argument parsing library where you can. Either 
your language’s built-in one, or a good third-party one. They will 
normally handle arguments, flag parsing, help text, and even spelling 
suggestions in a sensible way.

What are monad:
https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-a-monad-basic-theory-for-a-java-developer?edition=672394
two of the most commonly known Java 8 features are monad implementations, namely Stream and Optional

Monad is a concept:  we can view it as a wrapper which puts our value in some context and allows us to perform operations on the value. In this context, the output of an operation at any step is the input to the operation at the next step.

Simplifying Async/CompletableFuture code with BascomTask @ma
https://dzone.com/articles/lightweight-parallel-tasks-in-java-microservices
BascomTask is a lightweight task orchestration library that provides 
thread-level parallelization in a way that is as frictionless as 
possible. This means that, by design, using BascomTask is very close 
to pure Java code in both usage and performance, including use of 
CompletableFutures where they can be used effectively, but without 
having to rely solely on them for task-level organization of a 
codebase. BascomTask aims to compliment rather than replace 
CompletableFutures and freely integrates with them.

- Amdahl's law provides a formula to compute the theoretical maximum 
  speed up by providing multiple processors to an application. The 
  theoretical speedup is computed by S(n) = 1 / (B + (1-B)/n) where n 
  denotes the number of processors and B the fraction of the program 
  that cannot be executed in parallel. When n converges against 
  infinity, the term (1-B)/n converges against zero. Hence the formula 
  can be reduced in this special case to 1/B. As we can see, the 
  theoretical maximum speedup behaves reciprocal to the fraction that 
  has to be executed serially. This means the lower this fraction is, 
  the more theoretical speedup can be achieved.
