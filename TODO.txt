SPB Doc: add doc. about "patchy" solution ˂˃ (vs &gt;/&lt;)

- Add Support for Mermaid Graphs:
  https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
  <script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});</script>

- Doing so will command the mermaid parser to look for the <div> tags 
  with class="mermaid". From these tags mermaid will try to read the 
  diagram/chart definitons and render them into svg charts.

  no way in UI to un-select the non-existing-topic and an empty result
  is show for "AND" searchs.

·  CLASSIFICATION    (dificulty)     : dif1 -> dif2 -> ... -> dif10
·  CLASSIFICATION  2 (Soft LifeCicle): tools -> documentation -> development -> debugging ->
                                       validation (unitests, functional, ...) -> close 
                                       -> IOP (dev,tst,pre,beta,pro) -> monitorización -> incidencias -> QA
·  CLASSIFICATION  4 (Environement)  : DEV, TST, PRE, PRO
·  CLASSIFICATION  5 (Product)       : product1, product2, ...
