  <code>android.app.Activity</code>
<pre zoom>
- Activity is the presenter of a single screen in the app.
-  It has certain abilities, like displaying views, menus,
   alerts and notifications.
- It can also call another Activity, which means opening a new screen.
An application needs to have at least one Activity.
All Activities must be declared in the manifest file.

import android.content.Intent
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.view.View
import android.widget.EditText

const val KEY_EXTRA_MESSAGE = "com.example.myfirstapp.MESSAGE"

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }

    /** Called when the user taps the Send button */
    fun sendMessage(view: View) { /* needs implicit void /unit return value */
        val editText = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.editText)
        val message = editText.text.toString()
        ....
    }
}
</pre>

<td>
  <code>Broadcast receivers</code>
<pre zoom>

A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Because broadcast receivers are another well-defined entry into the app, the system can deliver broadcasts even to apps that aren't currently running. So, for example, an app can schedule an alarm to post a notification to tell the user about an upcoming event... and by delivering that alarm to a BroadcastReceiver of the app, there is no need for the app to remain running until the alarm goes off. Many broadcasts originate from the system—for example, a broadcast announcing that the screen has turned off, the battery is low, or a picture was captured. Apps can also initiate broadcasts—for example, to let other apps know that some data has been downloaded to the device and is available for them to use. Although broadcast receivers don't display a user interface, they may create a status bar notification to alert the user when a broadcast event occurs. More commonly, though, a broadcast receiver is just a gateway to other components and is intended to do a very minimal amount of work. For instance, it might schedule a JobService to perform some work based on the event with JobScheduler

A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of BroadcastReceiver and each broadcast is delivered as an Intent object. For more information, see the BroadcastReceiver class.

<td>
  <code>Content provider</code>
<pre zoom>
A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or modify the data if the content provider allows it. For example, the Android system provides a content provider that manages the user's contact information. As such, any app with the proper permissions can query the content provider, such as ContactsContract.Data, to read and write information about a particular person. It is tempting to think of a content provider as an abstraction on a database, because there is a lot of API and support built in to them for that common case. However, they have a different core purpose from a system-design perspective. To the system, a content provider is an entry point into an app for publishing named data items, identified by a URI scheme. Thus an app can decide how it wants to map the data it contains to a URI namespace, handing out those URIs to other entities which can in turn use them to access the data. There are a few particular things this allows the system to do in managing an app:

    Assigning a URI doesn't require that the app remain running, so URIs can persist after their owning apps have exited. The system only needs to make sure that an owning app is still running when it has to retrieve the app's data from the corresponding URI.
    These URIs also provide an important fine-grained security model. For example, an app can place the URI for an image it has on the clipboard, but leave its content provider locked up so that other apps cannot freely access it. When a second app attempts to access that URI on the clipboard,the system can allow that app to access the data via a temporary URI permission grant so that it is allowed to access the data only behind that URI, but nothing else in the second app.

Content providers are also useful for reading and writing data that is private to your app and not shared. For example, the Note Pad sample app uses a content provider to save notes.

A content provider is implemented as a subclass of ContentProvider and must implement a standard set of APIs that enable other apps to perform transactions. For more information, see the Content Providers developer guide.

A dream come true: Android is finally using DRM/KMS
Gustavo Padovan avatar

Posted on 17/12/2018 by Gustavo Padovan

In the beginning, Android did not really have a graphics stack. It was just pushing frames directly to framebuffers and hoping for the best, the approach worked for quite some time.

However, over time, the usecases became more and more complex and a new graphics stack was necessary. About 6 years ago the Android team conducted a lot of research and quickly realized that the mainline kernel was far from being up to the job - it was lacking Atomic screen updates, explicit syncronization and support for low power hardware, among other things. Google was left with no other choice than to design their own graphic stack: Atomic Display Framework (ADF).

That was another piece of the mainline linux kernel that Android forked, but it allowed Google to overcome the challenges brought on by the new needs of industry and customers.

The mainline graphics stack had a number of problems and the API was outdated and not keeping pace with the industry. The mainline graphics community knew it was time for an upgrade!
Atomic Modeset

The addition of Kernel Modeset (KMS) around 2008 was a revolution in itself, but as time passed, new needs arose and a new API was required. That lead to a situation where we had different syscalls to update every single buffer on the screen. In order to update the whole screen, for example, one would need to make a couple of syscalls and hope they would all be applied to the display hardware before the next vsync signal, otherwise some user noticeable flickering could happen. Unfortunately, such flickering was happening quite often.

Led by Daniel Vetter (Intel), the introduction of Atomic Modesetting on top of KMS in 2015 added a new system call that would contain *all* the information to update all buffers in all screens in a single commit transaction, fixing the issues that plagued the previous API. The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) Core went through a comprehensive refactoring process, and drivers became much easier to write, allowing for all the major drivers to be eventually ported to atomic modesetting, and many more added as well, some of them with Collabora's help.
Explicit Synchronization

Atomic Modeset was a giant step but there was still one piece missing: Explicit Synchronization. To avoid screen stalls and lack of knowledge about the current state of a buffer, ADF from Android introduced sync fences to keep track of buffer state and signal when GPU or Display is done filling or scanning it out.

In work led by Collabora, the Android Sync Framework was refactored and added to the mainline kernel, and Explicit Synchronization support was coded into DRM Atomic Modeset. The kernel now had all the pieces to support Android running on DRM/KMS.
A new reality

The dream finally came true in 2018 with the release of the Google Pixel 3, the first Android phone running with the mainline graphics stack. A feat that was deemed impossible 10 years ago is now a reality thanks to a lot of hard work from the entire community.

Google ChromeOS also benefited from Explicit Synchronization to improve support for Android apps on Chromebooks, and now the Chrome Browser also has Explicit Synchronization support.

As more vendors start to push their code to mainline, and follow upstream closely, we expect others Android phone vendors to switch to DRM/KMS too in the future. The upstream stack is now quite modern and robust, and the benefits of using it is becoming clear!

TODO: Clasify Android development
https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/11/android-architecture-components

Google has made available Android Architecture Components 1.0, a collection of libraries to design “robust, testable, and maintainable apps.” The current components are Lifecycle, LiveData, ViewModel and Room with others on the way.

Google has created Architecture Components to help with “persist data, manage the lifecycle of components, write modular applications, defense against common errors, write less boilerplate code.” The main components are:

Lifecycle is an architectural component used to create activities and fragments aware of their lifecycle, capable of adjusting their behavior based on their state. Components can go through multiple states – initialized, created, started, resumed, destroyed – and the lifecycle methods are called to perform various operations when a state event is triggered. Lifecycle will hold information about the status of a component, dealing with changes in status, and relieving the component of this tasks. The purpose is to write simpler code, easier to understand.

LiveData is an observable data holder class. LiveData is aware of the lifecycle of a component and provides updates when they are in an active state. LiveData is recommended to build reactive UIs.

ViewModel is another architectural component used to hold and manage data for activities or fragments, data which is preserved when the UI component is recreated in response to various user actions such as screen rotation. ViewModel is meant to hold some data-related code, resulting in the simplification of UI controllers.

Room is an object-mapping layer storing data in SQLite. Room includes query verification during compilation, to mark queries that might be erroneous. Google recommends using Room instead of directly accessing SQLite because data can be cached locally and it is integrated with LiveData, making it part of the component’s lifecycle.

In the near future, a new component will be made available, PagedList, which currently is in alpha. PageList is useful to gradually load data without waiting for large database queries to finish. They are also working on other architectural components that will be announced in the coming months.

Google has published Architecture Guidelines that explain how to use these components. They say the libraries are “ready for production” use, recommending using them to build Android applications.
