 - (Aka "Ethereum 2.0"):

   According to @[https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/06/15/ethereum-2-0-planned-for-launch-on-the-3rd-of-january-2020]
   ...Phase zero of ethereum 2.0, which enables Proof of Stake (PoS),
   is targeted to launch on theº2020-01-03º.
   - spec freeze: June 30th
   For new realistic targets, there are two milestones.
   - First, the deposit contract is to launch ahead
     of the genesis block to allow validators to make deposits.
     .. They’re hoping at least 2 million eth will be deposited
   - Second milestone is the genesis block launch on the day
     Satoshi Nakamoto did so for bitcoin.
   This would allow three months of deposits to accumulate
   and 7 months from today for at least two clients to reach
   production status, Drake said.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   production status == """there has been a long running cross
                           client testnet that has gone through
                           security audit, fuzzing, parts have
                           gone through formal verification, and
                           hasn’t suffered major issues for a
                           healthy amount of time."""

 - ... Ethereum was able to successfully execute a hard fork called Byzantium.
   As part of this hard fork ºincreased anonymity was provided through Zero-knowledge proofsº,
   or zk-snark proofs. It also included more predictable gas charges which were becoming
   difficult to calculate with the increased number of ICOs.
   InfoQ previously covered this hard fork
   - https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/08/Ethereum-HardFork

Serenity:
  - Ethereum 2.0 "last phase",
  - one key principle: switch to proof of stake
  - huge upgrades on the scalability side (sards, ...)

            2019-08-13
     - Phase 0 — The beacon chain
       - managing validators and stakes
       - organizing and electing committees and proposers
       - applying consensus rules
       - rewarding and penalizing/slashing
     - Phase 1 — Shards
       - constructing the shard chains and blocks
       - anchoring (cross-linking) shard blocks to beacon chain
       - ability to do bETH transfers between validators (this might come
         sooner as it’s not technically linked to work on sharding)
     - Phase 2 — Execution Environments
       - Ewasm based virtual machine for execution of the… execution environments
       - every shard has access to all execution environments
       - ability to make transactions within execution environments
       - ability to run and interact with smart contracts
       - cross-shard communication

2019-02-22: @[https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/02/22/ethereum-constantinople-st-petersburg-upgrade-announcement/]
- scheduled upgrade at block number 7,280,000,  predicted on 2019-02-28.

- Constantinople and St. Petersburg are the names given to this network upgrade.
  Previous network upgrades have been given other names such as Spurious Dragon and Byzantium.
  The reason that this network upgrade has two names is because the original Constantinople
  network upgrade was postponed and two protocol upgrades will need to occur on the same
  block number in order to fix issues on various Ethereum test networks, such as Ropsten.

<span xsmall>EVM state</span>
@[https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/12/30/eth1x-files-state-of-stateless-ethereum/]
- 400 million nodes in the state trie. Of these, about 3,000 (but as
  many as 6,000) need to be added or modified every 15 seconds.
  Staying in sync with the Ethereum blockchain is, effectively,
  constantly building a new version of the state trie over
  and over again.
   ... This multi-step process of state trie database operations is why
  Ethereum implementations are so taxing on disk I/O and memory, and
  why even a “fast sync” can take up to 6 hours to complete, even
  on fast connections. To run a full node in Ethereum, a fast SSD (as
  opposed to a cheap, reliable HDD) is a requirement, because
  processing state changes is extremely demanding on disk read/writes.

 *2: account.storage: Persistent memory area
     - It is not possible to enumerate storage from within a contract
     - It is comparatively costly to read and even more so, to modify storage
       in the context of an (update state) TX. (It's still free of cost during
       external query calls).
     - A contract can neither read nor write to any storage apart from its own

Signing transactions Flow:
 - Identify the next available nonce for the sender account
 - Create the RawTransaction object
 - Encode the RawTransaction object using Recursive Length Prefix encoding
 - Sign the RawTransaction object
 - Send the RawTransaction object to a node for processing

Theºnonceºis an increasing numeric value which is used to uniquely identify
transactions.ºA nonce can only be used once and until a transaction is mined,º
it is possible to send multiple versions of a transaction with the same nonce,
however, once mined, any subsequent submissions will be rejected.

 º*1º: target can also be an external (non-contract) account (or even == "sender")

 º*2º: Enough gas to execute called function, but small enought to avoid
       wasting too-much ethers (because of software bugs, gas-price, ...)
       Contracts decide how much remaining gas is sent within calls to other
       contracts.
     BºAn (out-of-gas|*) exception in inner message call is signalled by anº
     Bºerror value put onto the stack.                                     º
     BºThe gas sent is consumed. º
     BºBy default in  Solidity calling contract re-launch a manual exception º
     Bºto make exceptions "bubble up" the remote call stack.º

 º*3º: return data is stored at ºpreallocated locationº in caller's memory.
     Rºreturn data of top-level call is not usedº, since client disconnects as
       soon as local node cofirms Signed TX reception.
       sc01.funcA will use async Events to communicate results.
       (original external client and any other interested cliet will listen for
        such events)

 - Calls depth is limited to 1024 (Prefer loops to recursive calls)

<span xspam>DELEGATE CALL</span>
( EVM DELEGATECALL opcode, Homestead+ )
- mostly indentical to a message call BUT
  - called code is executed in the context of the calling contract
    - Same EVM stack?
    - sender == origial msg.sender
    - value  == origial msg.value
    - Same storage
    - Same current balance
    - Different Code

- Used in libraries, since it allows a contract to dynamically load code
  from a different address at runtime.
  For example to manipulate Complex data structures.
  Library code is deployed once at a specific address and their code is
  through DELEGATECALL.
BºIn comparison to contracts libraries:º
Bº- Have no state variables. A reference to struct must be passed.º
Bº- Cannot inherit nor be inheritedº
Bº- Cannot recieve Etherº

- Could represent a Rºsecurity riskºfor calling contract
  whichRºneeds to trust that the receiving contractº while
  manipulating its own storage.

- Replaces Rºdeprecated CALLCODEº fixing bug since CALLCODE did not
  preserve msg.sender and msg.value.

  <span xsmall>EVM Summary</span>

- Ethereum Virtual Machine Opcodes low level reference to EVM:
 @[https://ethervm.io/]
- EVM Illustrated (TODO)
  @[https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf]
- TODO: @[https://kauri.io/article/766e5d1e1ba240a7976943b659a871fc/v1/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-(evm)-part-2:-memory-and-storage]
- TODO: Awesome EVM list:
@[https://github.com/pirapira/awesome-ethereum-virtual-machine]

 ºOpcodes:º
@[https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes]
- EVM is a 256bit machine. It is most natural to manipulate data in chunks of 32 bytes.
- Persistent storage is quite expensive.
- The Solidity compiler makes interesting choices in order to minimize gas usage.

- To interact with a Smart Contract, you send it raw bytes.
- It does some computation, possibly changing its own state,
  and then sends you raw bytes in return.
- Method calling does not actually exist. It is a collective
  illusion created by the ABI.
- The ABI is specified like a low-level format, but in function
  it's more like a serialization format for a cross-language RPC framework.
- We could draw analogies between the architectural tiers of DApp and Web App:
  - The blockchain is like the backing database
  - A contract is like a web service
  - A transaction is like a request
  - ABI is the data-interchange format, like Protocol Buffer


ºEVM Events:º
 - In the wild, there are three main uses for event logs:
   - As ersatz return values, because a transaction does not record a
     method's return values.
   - As a kind of cheaper alternative data storage, as long as the
     contract does not need access to it.
     According to the Yellow paper:
     "...There is no size limit to the data: you will be limited by how
         much Ether you have. (And of course the block gas limit.).The size
         limit of one event is a function of the block's gas limit, which as
         of now tends to be around 3,145,192 (i.e., the first seven digits of
         pi). According to Jonathan Patrick, logging costs 76 gas per byte. So
         I'd assume you could get in around 41kb per log event...."

   - Events that DApp clients can subscribe to.
 - Event logging map to EVM logging primitives.
   event Deposit( address indexed _from, bytes32 indexed _id, uint _value);
 -ºEvent limitationsº:
   - There may be at most 3 indexed parameters.
   - If the type of an indexed parameter is larger than 32 bytes,
     only the KECCAK256 digest of the data is stored.
 -  EVM Log Primitives log0, log1, ..., log4 EVM instructions.
    - The EVM logging facility uses different terminologies than Solidity:
   "topics": There may be up to 4 topics exactly 32 bytes each
            Solidity consumes one topic for the event's signature so only 3 are available
   "data"  : Payload of the event. It may be arbitrary number of bytes

 - Bloom filters are used to speed up search-by-topic

*EVM Memory:
- A contract obtains a freshly cleared instance for each message call
- Memory is linear and can be addressed at byte level
- ºReads are limited to a width of 256 bitsº
- ºWrites can be either 8 bits or 256 bits wideº
- Memory is expanded by a word (256-bit), when accessing
    (either reading or writing) a previously untouched memory word (ie.
    any offset within a word). At the time of expansion, the cost in gas
    must be paid. Memory is more costly the larger it grows (it scales
    quadratically)
- calldata: Separate area of memory whe message call payload is placed

ºEVM Stack:º
- EVM memory area list of 256bits up to 1024 elements used for computations
- The 16 topmost elements can be moved to the top or swaped wih the top element
- All other operations take the topmost one (or two, or more) elements and push
  the result onto the stack
- top elements can be moved to/from storage/memory, but deeper elements can
  be accessed without first removing elements on top of them.

- (EVM)full computational state: can be defined by the tuple:
  (block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas)
  block_state = global state = all accounts (balances + storage)

- selfdestruct(target): Destructor for contract @ address
  - Remaining Ethers are sent to target
  - storage ⅋ code are removed from the blockchain state

- The encoding is not self describing and thus requires a schema in order to decode.
- Interface functions of a contract are strongly typed
  (known at compilation time and static)
- All contracts will have the interface definitions of any contracts they call a
  vailable at compile-time.
- Data is encoded according to its type

˂b˃ARGUMENT (and return value) ENCODING:˂/b˃
- Starting from fifth byte

- ºELEMENTARY TYPESº:
  - uint˂M˃ : unsigned                integer type of 8,16,24,...256 bits,
  -  int˂M˃ : two's complement signed integer type of 8,16,24,...256 bits,
  - address : typed uint160 (function selector uses address not uint160)
  - bool    : typed uint8 restricted to values 0, 1.
  -  fixed˂M˃x˂N˃: "M / (10 ºº N)" value signed fixed-point decimal number
                   M bits from 8,16,...256
                   N bits from 0,8,...80
  - ufixed˂M˃x˂N˃: unsigned variant of fixed˂M˃x˂N˃.
  - fixed,   : synonyms for fixed128x18, ufixed128x18 respectively.
    ufixed
  - bytes˂M˃: binary type of M bytes, 0 ˂ M ˂= 32.
  - function: an address (20 bytes) followed by a function selector (4 bytes).
              Encoded identical to bytes24.

- º(fixed-size) arrayº:
  ˂type˃[M]: a fixed-length array of M elements, M ˃= 0, of the given type.

- ºnon-fixed-size types existº:
  - bytes   : dynamic sized byte sequence
  - string  : dynamic sized unicode string assumed to be UTF-8 encoded
  - ˂type˃[]: a variable-length array of elements of the given type

- ºtuple:º (or tuples of tuples, arrays of tuples,...)
  - (T1,T2,...,Tn): tuple consisting of the types T1, …, Tn, n ˃= 0

- ºMapping Solidity to ABI types:º
Solidity     ABI Type
contract     address
enum         smallest uint type large enough to hold all values
struct       tuple

ºFormal Specification of the Encodingº
- We distinguish two types:
  - static : encoded in-place.
  - dynamic: encoded at a separately allocated location after the current block.
             - bytes
             - string
             - T[] for any T
             - T[k] for any dynamic T and any k ˃= 0
             - (T1,...,Tk) if Ti is dynamic for some 1 ˂= i ˂= k

- Definitions:
  - len(a) :  (uint256) number of bytes in a binary string a
  - enc    :  actual encoding binary string:
              ABI_type_Value → enc(ABI_type_Value)
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                           len(enc(ABI_type_Value)) depends on:
                               - ABI_type_Value if type of ABI_type_Value is dynamic.
                               - ABI_type       if type of ABI_type_Value is  static.

ºEvents ABI Encodingº
- Log entries provide the contract's address,
- Up to four topics
- some arbitrary length binary data.

Given an event name and series of event parameters, we split them into two sub-series:
 - indexed     parameters: used in Keccak-event-signature to form the topics of the log entry.
 - non-indexed parameters: byte array of the event.

In effect, a log entry using this ABI is described as:
 - contract_address (emiting the event)

 - topics[0]: keccak(EVENT_NAME+"("+EVENT_ARGS.map(canonical_type_of).join(",")+")")

 - topics[n]: abi_encode(EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS[n - 1])
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                       EVENT_ARGS that are indexed

 - data     : ABI encoding of EVENT_NON_INDEXED_ARGS


- if type-byte-length ˂= 32 → value padded/sign-extended          to 32 bytes is included
- if type-byte-length ˃  32 → Keccak hash of a special in-place encoded value is included

BEST PATTERNS:
- External clients must be able to restore current contract state
  by just reading events.
- Ethereum can return just a very limited information in each
  read-only query. (Up to 7 fields). That means that reports and
  data-analysis must be done on event logs.
- Contract/s state/s must be consulted only by code originated by
  a new transaction trying to update the current state.

- Logs: It is possible to store data in a specially indexed data structure
  that maps all the way up to the block level.
  This feature called 'logs' is used to implement events.
- Contracts ºCAN NOTº access log data after it has been created, but they
  can be efficiently accessed from outside the blockchain.
  Since some part of the log data is stored in bloom filters,
  it is possible to search for this data in an efficient and cryptographically
  secure way, so network peers that do not download the whole blockchain
  ("light clients") can still find these logs.
- Logs were designed to be a form of storage that costs significantly
  less gas than contract storage:
  Logs basically[3] cost 8 gas per byte, whereas contract storage costs 20,000 gas per 32 bytes.
  Up to 3 parameters can be indexed.

ºEvent Limits:º
- Up to 3 indexed fields.
- Up to 7 fields (indexed + non-indexed fields)
- The size limit of one event is a function of the block's gas limit,
  ~ 3_145_192 (first seven digits of pi * 2)
  With a gas costs of 76 gas per byte limit is about 41kb per log event.

Transaction
-------------
address sender
target
payload        "message" sent from src. account to a target (account or code)
wei ether

wei gasPrice
wei gas

return data

- Note that a TX in blockchain is an intention to modify the state of the ddbb.
  It's up to the consensus algorithm to decide when and/or whether the TX will
  be accepted:
  transaction.target := address | code | "zero-account"

if target == code
   → code is executed
      input data = transaction.payload
if target == "zero.."
   → step 1: new contract created
     step 2: transaccion.payload is executed
     step 3: exec. output stored as contract.code
     (→ trans.payload == code factory of contract code)

- transaction.ether: Price in Wei of one unit of gas, in which VM operations are priced.
- The product of gasPrice and gas represents the maximum amount of Wei we are
  willing to pay for executing the transaction. gasPrice is used by miners to
  rank transactions for inclusion in the blockchain.

- transaction.gas: Its purpose is to limit the amount of work needed to execute the transaction
  and to pay for this execution.
- transaction creator (sender?) chooses the gas to pay.
    - If execution gas ˂ transaction.gas =˃ Refund to sender
    - If execution gas ˃ transaction.gas =˃ out-of-gas exception triggered
        (reverts all modifications made to the state in current call frame)

- nonce: increasing numeric value which is used to uniquely identify transactions.
  A nonce can only be used once and until a transaction is mined, it is possible
  to send multiple versions of a transaction with the same nonce, however,
  once mined, any subsequent submissions will be rejected.
  A repeated nonce can be used to overwrite a pending TX.

ºblock validation algorithm (Consensus)º
- Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid
- Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous
  block and less than 15 minutes into the future.
- Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit
  (various low-level Ethereum-specific concepts) are valid.
- Check that the proof of work on the block is valid
- Let S[0] be the STATE_ROOT of the previous block
- Let TX be the block's transaction list, with n transactions. For all "i" in
  0,...n-1, set S[i+1] = APPLY (S[i],TX[i]). If any applications returns an error, or
  if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the GASLIMIT,
  return an error
- Let S_FINAL be S[n], but adding the block reward paid to the miner
- Check if S_FINAL is the same as the STATE_ROOT. If it is, the block is valid;
      otherwise, it is not.
- Note: coinbase: In a mining node indicates the address where rewards will go.
  Must be set to an account owned by miner

<span xsmall>TX Signing</span>
REF:
@[https://medium.com/@angellopozo/ethereum-signing-and-validating-13a2d7cb0ee3]
@[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/191]

- Ethereum uses SECP256K1 (one of the ECDSA supported algorithms) for signature.
  Note:
  - secp256k1 public key is composed of two integers
    (output of an ECDSA signature): (r, s).
  - The secp256k1 ETH/BTC library, however, defines the public key as
    (r||s||v), where v = 0 or 1.
           ^        ^^^^^^^^^^^
     when you derive the public keyºfrom the signatureº, two solutions surge.
     v will tell which one is the right one.
     - if length of the public key is 64 bytes (not hex encoded) r||s is used.
       if length is 65 bytes, r||s||v will be used.
     - v is the recovery id.
  - More info at @[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/38351/ecdsa-v-r-s-what-is-v]
    Ethereum makes further adjustments to v in order to prevent replay attack as explained in
    @[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/155]]

  - In the SmartContract we can use:
    ecrecover Solidity Global Crypto Funct:
    ecrecover (bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
      returns (address): recover the address associated with the public key
                         from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error

  - NOTE: The use of Curve25519 with Schnoor signing scheme (Ed25519) is under discussion

<span xsmall>Ether TXs in Solidity:</span>
addressInstance.balance (uint256): balance in Wei
addressInstance.transfer(uint256 amount):
    msg.sender →(amount in wei) → addressInstance
    throws on failure

addressInstance.send(uint256 amount): returns (bool):
    msg.sender → (amount in wei) → addressInstance
    returns true/false, does NOT throw an exception

- In addressInstance.transfer (or send), if addressInstance
  is a contract address, its code (more specifically: its fallback function, if present)
  will be executed together with the transfer call. This is a limitation of the EVM and
  cannot be prevented.
  If that execution runs out of gas or fails in any way, the Ether transfer will be
  reverted and the current contract will stop with an exception.
<hr/>
<span xsmall TODO>ECRecover</span>
@[http://coders-errand.com/ecrecover-signature-verification-ethereum/]
ECRecover and Signature Verification in Ethereum | Coder's Errand
...As seen in the previous post of this series, a signature scheme
usually has a verification algorithm that computes directly over the
public key and the signature to check if the latter is valid.
Ethereum is different, and uses ECRecover instead. ECDSA allows for
an alternative approach, where a signature is not verified directly.

• Gas rationale:
  · Gas protect against DoS attacks and buggy nodes, EVMs, and/or smart-contracts.
  · Price cost applies to public network and (optionally) to private/consortium networks.
    NOTE: private/consortium networks will still be constrained to
          gas limits even when gas price is ZERO. [TODO]: Recheck
  · TXs will fail if the consume too much gas ("CPU" or storage)

@[https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/06/16/eth1x-1559/]                [scalability][gas_price]
• Problem Context:
Rº• TX gas price can spike when block ussage is close to full.º
  • wallets trying to pay "fast" (vs waiting for TX demand/fees
    to go down) might end up paying ridiculous fees.
    (Supported by Besu and other clients).
• EIP-1559 dramatically alter how gas fees are calculated.
  • TX fees broken into two categories:
    ✓ºbase feeº :Bºpredictableº based on how TX number in last block.
      ·ºbase fee will be burned (removed from circulation)º vs going
        into miner's pockets.
      · base fee dynamically adjust so that the overall gas usage in
        a block moves toward the current limit of 10 million gas.

    ✓ºMiner tipº: added at will by TX users in order to incentivize
                  miners to include their TX in mined block.

NOTES:
 • EIP-1559 does NOT reduce TX fees.
 • technical "Layer 2" rollup solutions used to reduce fees:

<span xsmall>Calls vs TXs</span>
Imagine a solidity code similar to:

  contract Voting {
    mapping (uint /*proposal */=˃ uint /*total votes*/) countMap;
    event totalForProposal(uint total)
    ...
    function vote(uint proposalID)
    returns (uint total) {
       countMap[proposalID] = votes[proposalID]++;
       unit bºresultº = countMap[proposalID];
       emit totalForProposals(Bºresultº)
       return Bºresultº
    }
    ...
  }
This is function will modify the state of the blockchain
(it's not a "view"  or "pure" function in Solidity parlance)

Calling this function from "outside" the blockchain is done through
a criptographically signed transaction. The module (mobile wallet,
middleware,...) sending the signed transaction will wait indefinetely
while the TX is first propagated through the network to a mining node
, then mined (the miner executes the contract) and the TX receipt
received later on in a mined block).
The only way tthis external module has to fetch the result of the
function is through asynchronous eventsi,

This same function can be called in the mid of another transaction
when another method indirectly call it. This time, and that's why
the solidity code includes an "emit totalFroProposals..." as to
allow the module to be notified of the result.

- This function can also be part of a bigger execution path an called
in the mid of an started transaction. The EVM will already be executing
some method that in turn calls this "vote" function as part of a
normal program execution. When the "vote" function returns it has
access to the returned result since it has been placed on the EVM
stack. The emitted event is ignored (actually will be included in
the block after mining to be propagated back to any listening
application).

Note also that we can have read-only functions ("view" or "pure"
in Solidity parlance"). In that case both an external module or
an internal function can fetch the returned value inmediatelly
(there is no TX propagation or mining and all the needed data
is local to the closest ethereum node -geth, parity,...-).
The javascript web3js (or java web3j or ...)
In the case of the external module through an RPC call, and in
the case of an internal EVM function through the (much faster)
EVM stack.

APPLY (S, TX) → S'  ← S : initial global state
                    ← S': final   global state
 can be defined as follows:
- Check if incomming TX is well-formed (right number of values),
  signature is valid, and the nonce matches the nonce in the
  sender's account.  Return an error otherwise.
- Calculate the transaction fee as STAR_GAS * GAS_PRICE, and
  determine the sending address from the signature. Subtract the
  fee from the sender's account balance and increment the
  sender's nonce. If sender's balance ˂ fee, return an error.
- Initialize GAS = STARTGAS, and take off a certain quantity
  of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction.
- Transfer the TX value from the sender's account to the
  receiving account.  If the receiving account does not yet
  exist, create if. If the receiving account is a contract,
  run the contract's code either to completion or until the
  execution runs out of gas.
- If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have
  enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert
  all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add
  the fees to the miner's account
- Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to
  the sender, and send the fees paid for gas consumed to the

<span xsmall>About 24K</span>
<span xsmall>Contract Size</span>
[https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/removing-or-increasing-the-contract-size-limit/3045]

BºNote:º Besu (maybe others) allows to tune max.contract size
         in consortium / private networks.

RºWARN: I admit that I haven’t kept up with the 2.0 specs and all my statements are º
       ºbased on eth 1.x. º

(See original link for -very- detailed info)

- EIP #170 22 establish a max contract size of 24KB to solve the problem:
  "When a contract is called, even though the call takes a constant amount of gas,
  the call can trigger O(n) cost in terms of reading the code from disk, preprocessing
  the code for VM execution, and also adding O(n) data to the Merkle proof for the
  block’s proof-of-validity".

ºCurrent Solutionº
- Delegate call proxy patterns and Libraries:
  Using delegate calls, you can store the code of your smart contract in parts
  in different contracts and have a "dispatcher" contract that calls the actual
  contract using delegate calls.
  - Please refer to ZeppelinOS’s upgradability contracts 8 and EIP #1538 3.

  -ºLimitationsº
    - extra unnecessary code.
    - Proxy patterns add another attack vector.
    - Proxy patterns make calls to contracts a lot more
      expensive as the Proxy has to copy the parameters make an
      external delegate call every time.
    - Proxy patterns like EIP 1538 also make inter-logic contract call
      a lot more expensive.
       external call -> proxy    -> contract -> contract2
                        contract    call
    - hurt readability for the end user:
      - The actual contract code/ABI of the proxy is different from the one
        we need to access the contract behind the proxy. Like it or not but
        most people can barely use the read/write features in etherscan,
       they can't load a custom ABI and make web3 calls.
    - Proxies make smart contract development slightly more complex.
    - Proxies make it harder to verify the actual code and hence reduce trust.
    - Loading a large contract will be fast-sequential read while loading
      multiple small ones will be slow-random read.

ºPossible Solutionsº
- Increase contract size limit to 32,768 (2**15) proposed by @gavofyork in
  EIP 170 discussion 8. (50% code increase)
- If required, relevant opcodes like CALL can have their cost increased
  by a bit through EIP #1838 4.
- Allow infinite contract size by Implementing paging of contract code
  as suggested by @SergioDemianLerner in EIP #170 discussion 3.
  "Make contracts a vector of 24 Kbytes pages".
  - first page is loaded for free when a CALL is received while jumping
    or running into another page pays a fee (500 gas) because the page
    must be fetched from disk.
- Allow infinite contract size and make the cost of OPCODES like CALL
  dynamic to allow for this change. Code size will still be limited by
  block gas limit. This is a moderate difficulty change but makes a lot
  of sense IMO. More on this later:
  - In detail:
    - ethereum account   (array in state trie)
      ----------------
       nonce
       balance
       storageRoot
       codeHash
      ºcodeSize     ←-- New proposed additionº
       ^^^^^^^^
      - Whenever a new contract is deployed, its size is stored here
      - If a contract is destructed, codeSize is reseted.

    - CALL, DELEGATECALL, CALLCODE , ... opcodes should charge additional
      X(3?) gas per extra word if the contract code size is greater than 24KB.
  - Rationale
    The only reason why the contract size was limited was to prevent people
    from exploiting the fixed costs. We can overcome this by making the
    costs variable. The codeSize element will help in calculating call cost
    before reading the whole contract and eventually throwing OOG.
    - Merkle proofs will also be generated at a fixed cost as we won't have
      to load whole contracts from disk first. The codeSize should be enough
      for generating Merkle proofs of calls that are going to be OOG due
      to contract size.
  - Backwards Compatibility
    - All existing accounts have less than 24KB of code, so no extra cost
      has to be charged from calls being sent to them.

<span xsmall>Issues</span>
REF: @[https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/267/why-dont-ethereum-addresses-have-checksums]
Initial Ethereum design didn't have support for address checksum.
thus, a single mistyped digit could make sending to an invalid
address (loosing all the money).

Q: Was it an oversight that was overlooked by the designers?
A: the raw hexadecimal string ussually called "Ethereum address"
   wasn't even intended to be the standard way of representing such information.
   containing no checksums. On top of it software can be written
   creating an encoding and string in base 58 with built-in version number
   and checksum, 100% interoperable by silently decoding the new

NOTE: always include "0x" prefix in front of raw addresses

<span xsmall>ICAP Addresses</span>
<span xsmall>IBAM Compatible</span>
@[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Inter-exchange-Client-Address-Protocol-(ICAP)]
- ICAP: Inter Exchange Client Address Protocol (ICAP)
- compatible with IBAN account formatting.

It looks like: "XE7338O073KYGTWWZN0F2WZ0R8PX5ZPPZS".

- (it uses a wider range of alphanumeric characters to save
  space and includes a checksum. similar to Bitcoin)

- ICAP is a fully valid International Bank Account Number (or IBAN).

- It doesn't use hexadecimal addresses. BY the help of ENS
  it can just use an actual human-readable-string to end up
  with something like "XE81ETHXREGJEFFCOLEMAN".
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                   "XE81 ETH XREG JEFF COLEMAN"
                  (It still matches bank formats)

 Update 2016-02: Vitalik ºtransitionalº checksumming:
  - provides some additional protection against accidental errors
  while remaining backwards compatible with wallets that doesn't support
  the checksum (and will ignore the case differences).

  - Ex: Input address '0xcd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826'

    Output checksumed:'0xCd2a3d9f938e13Cd947eC05ABC7fe734df8DD826'
                         ^             ^     ^  ^^^         ^^
                         └──────────────────────────────────────┘
            letters are in the same corresponding place as a "1" bit
            in the raw binary keccack-256 hash of the address bytes
            are capitalised. Numbers are unchanged.

GOAL: resolve human-readable names to Ethereum addresses, Swarm/IPFS hashes, ....
      provide also metadata about names (contracts ABIs, whois info,...)
- ENS operates on a system of Oºdot-separated hierarchial names called domainsº,
  with the owner of a domain having full control over the distribution of subdomains.

- Top-level domains (.eth, .test,...) owned by 'registrars' smart contracts
  Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts,
  obtain ownership of a second-level domain for their own use.

- Secure: ENS is built on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning
  it doesn't suffer from the insecurity of the DNS system.  You can be confident
  names you enter work the way their owner intended.

- Truly Distributed: ENS operates in a distributed fashion for both its infrastructure
  and governance. Anyone can register a .eth domain name for themselves by participating
  in an auction process, mediated by the blockchain.

ºTERMINOLOGYº
  - domain     : complete, human-readable form of a name; eg, ‘vitalik.wallet.eth’
  - label      : a single component of a domain; eg, ‘vitalik’, ‘wallet’, or ‘eth’
  - label hash : keccak-256(label) eg, keccak256(‘eth’) =
                 0x4f5b812789fc606be1b3b16908db13fc7a9adf7ca72641f84d75b47069d3d7f0
  - node       : namehash function output used to uniquely identify a name in ENS

Ethereum WebAssembly is a proposed redesign of the Ethereum smart
contract execution layer using a deterministic subset of WebAssembly.
The use of WebAssembly as a format for smart contracts gains a
variety of benefits, a few of which are listed below:
- Near-native execution speed for smart contracts
- The possibility to develop smart contracts in many traditional
  programming languages, such as C, C++, and Rust
- Access to a vast developer community and the toolchain surrounding WebAssembly

<span xsmall>What's New</span>
BºSolidity 0.8 Breaking changesº
  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/080-breaking-changes.rst

  - Silent Changes of the Semantics
    - Arithmetic operations revert on underflow and overflow.
      You can use ºunchecked { ... }º to go back to previous wrapping behaviour.
      (better readability of code withslight increase of gas costs)

  Bº- ABI coder v2 is activated by default.º: Use ºpragma abicoder v1;º for backward compatibility.
      - supports for more types
      - sanity checks on inputs.
      -Rºsome fun. calls are more expensiveº
      -"pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2" not-needed/redundant.

    - internal checks (failing assertions,div-by-zero, overflow,...) translate to revert (vs invalid) opcode.
      Bºsaving gas on errorsº while  allowing static analysis tools to distinguish
      them from  invalid-input-reverts (failing "require").

    - If a byte array in storage is accessed whose length is encoded incorrectly, a panic is caused.
      A contract cannot get into this situation unless inline assembly is used to modify the raw representation of storage byte arrays.

    - constants 'variables' values used in array length expressions as intermediate expressions properly rounded.
      (previously, arbitrary precision used in all branches of the evaluation tree).

    - "byte" removed in favor of "bytes1".

  - New Restrictions
    - removed ambiguous syntax "here and there".
    - Address literals have the type "address" (vs "address payable"). Use explicit conversion. Ex:
      payable(0xdCad3a6d3569DF655070DEd06cb7A1b2Ccd1D3AF).

    - explicit type conversions only allowed forºat mostºone change in sign, width or type-category.
     ºmultiple changes will require multiple conversionsº. Ex: uint16(int8) →  uint16(uint8(int8))
                                                                               ^lenght^sign

    - call options can only be given once: c.f{gas: 10000}{value: 1}() →  c.f{gas: 10000, value: 1}()

    - ºenumº max length 256 members. (allows to assume uint8)

    - global vars 'tx.origin' and 'msg.sender' have type "address"` (vs payable address)
      Ex: msg.sender.transfer(x) → payable(msg.sender).transfer(x)

  - See source to check How update old code

Bº0.7.0º
  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/070-breaking-changes.rst
  - Silent Changes of the Semantics
    - Exponentiation and shifts of literals by non-literals (e.g. 1 ˂˂ x or 2 ** x)
      will always use either the type uint256 or int256

    - Ether and gas is now specified using a new syntax:
      x.f{gas: 10000, value: 2 ether}(arg1, arg2) vs x.f.gas(10000).value(2 ether)(arg1, arg2)

    -Rºglobal variable ºnowº is deprecatedº
     Bºblock.timestamp should be used insteadº.

    - NatSpec comments on variables only allowed for public state variables

  Bº- Unicode string literals supported now.  unicode"Hello 😃"º

    - state mutability of functions can now be restricted during inheritance                        [qa]
      with "pure" and "view".

    - structs and arrays containing mapping can only be used in storage.
      (Previously, mapping members Rºsilently skipped in memoryº)

    - Assignments to structs or arrays in storage does not work if they contain mappings.
      (Previously, mapping members Rºsilently skipped during the copy operationº)

    - Visibility (public/external) not needed in constructors anymore.
    Bº To prevent a contract from being created, mark it as ºabstractº.

    - using A for B must be repeated in all derived contracts of B.
BºSolidity 0.6 Breaking changesº
  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/060-breaking-changes.rst

  - Breaking changes:
    - Explicitness Requirements:
      - only functions marked as virtual can be overridden.
      - "override" must be used in implementing children.

    - Member-access to ".length" in arrays is always read-only (including storage ones).
      No possible to resize storage arrays by assigning a new value to their length.
      Use "push()/pop()" or "push(value)" instead.
      push(value) for dynamic storage arrays returns nothing (new length previously)
      This prevents storage collisions of gigantic storage arrays.

    - "abstract" keyword can be used to mark contracts as abstract.
      - This avoids creating such contracts with "new" operator.
      - not possible to generate bytecode for them during compilation.

    - Libraries have to implement all their functions, not only the internal ones.

    - unnamed "fallback function" split up into:
      - fallback function marked with "fallback" keyword.
        - called when no other function matches
        - can be payable or not.
      - receive  function marked with "receive " keyword. implicitly "payable".
        - called whenever the call data is empty (with/without ether received).

  - New Features
  Bº- try/catch statement allows to react on failed external calls.º              [qa][error-handling]
    - "struct" and "enum" types can be declared at file level.
    - Array slices can be used for calldata arrays.
      e.g.: low-level way to decode function call payload
            abi.decode(msg.dataº[4:]º, (uint, uint))" [TODO]
    - Natspec supports multiple return parameters in developer documentation.
    - "address" → "address payable" conversion thanks to: payable(myaddress)
    - compiler now appends the `IPFS ˂https://ipfs.io/˃`_ hash of the metadata file to the
      end of the bytecode by default (previously swarn hash by default)

<span xsmall>Learn X in Y min</span>
Summary from @[https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/]
- statically typed.
- OOP: a contract ("class")  contains state variables, private/public functions

-ºEvent-stream oriented:º
  - Clients "outside" the ethereum network send
    ºsigned TXsº to the network.ºEventuallyº those TXs will be
    accepted ("mined") by the consensus and the modified state
    eventually propagated back with the propagation on new
    accepted ("mined") blocks.
    Each TXs can also create new inmutable logs that are also
    propagated back with the new mined block propagation.
    (See "events" topic for related info)

  First Important different when compared with standard languages:
  - A function invoqued "outside" the network (from a new
    signed TX pending to be mined) can return values, but
    those values will be ignored (except, maybe by the
    debugger during the development phase). Events are used
    to inform the client about application-layer data.
    (Some low level-EVM data can be directly extracted from the
    TX receipt, like the gas spent, hash, ...).

º1. DATA TYPES AND ASSOCIATED METHODSº
// there are no doubles or floats.
uint    constant a = 8; // 32 bytes (256bits)
uint256 constant a = 8; // same effect
 int    constant a = 8; // 32 bytes signed int
 int    constant a = 0x123A1; // hex notation

// All state variables (those outside a function)
// are by default 'internal' and accessible inside contract
// and in all contracts that inherit ONLY
// Need to explicitly set to 'public' to allow external contracts to access
int256 public a = 8;

// For int and uint, can explicitly set space in steps of 8 up to 256
// e.g., int8, int16, int24
uint8 b;
int64 c;
uint248 e;

// Be careful that you don't overflow, and protect against attacks that do
// For example, for an addition, you'd do:
uint256 c = a + b;
assert(c ˃= a); // assert tests for internal invariants; require is used for user inputs
// For more examples of common arithmetic issues, see Zeppelin's SafeMath library
// https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol


// No random functions built in, use other contracts for randomness

// Type casting
int x = int(b);

bool b = true; // or do 'var b = true;' for inferred typing

// Addresses - holds 20 byte/160 bit Ethereum addresses
// No arithmetic allowed
address public owner;

// Types of accounts:
// Contract account: address set on create (func of creator address, num transactions sent)
// External Account: (person/external entity): address created from public key

// Add 'public' field to indicate publicly/externally accessible
// a getter is automatically created, but NOT a setter

// All addresses can be sent ether
owner.transfer(SOME_BALANCE); // fails and reverts on failure

// Can also do a lower level .send call, which returns a false if it failed
if (owner.send) {} // REMEMBER: wrap send in 'if', as contract addresses have
// functions executed on send and these can fail
// Also, make sure to deduct balances BEFORE attempting a send, as there is a risk of a recursive
// call that can drain the contract

// Can check balance
owner.balance; // the balance of the owner (user or contract)


// Bytes available from 1 to 32
byte a; // byte is same as bytes1
bytes2 b;
bytes32 c;

// Dynamically sized bytes
bytes m; // A special array, same as byte[] array (but packed tightly)
// More expensive than byte1-byte32, so use those when possible

// same as bytes, but does not allow length or index access (for now)
string n = "hello"; // stored in UTF8, note double quotes, not single
// string utility functions to be added in future
// prefer bytes32/bytes, as UTF8 uses more storage

// Type inference
// var does inferred typing based on first assignment,
// can't be used in functions parameters
var a = true;
// use carefully, inference may provide wrong type
// e.g., an int8, when a counter needs to be int16

// var can be used to assign function to variable
function a(uint x) returns (uint) {
    return x * 2;
}
var f = a;
f(22); // call

// by default, all values are set to 0 on instantiation

// Delete can be called on most types
// (does NOT destroy value, but sets value to 0, the initial value)
uint x = 5;


// Destructuring/Tuples
(x, y) = (2, 7); // assign/swap multiple values


// 2. DATA STRUCTURES
// Arrays
bytes32[5] nicknames; // static array
bytes32[] names; // dynamic array
uint newLength = names.push("John"); // adding returns new length of the array
// Length
names.length; // get length
names.length = 1; // lengths can be set (for dynamic arrays in storage only)

// multidimensional array
uint x[][5]; // arr with 5 dynamic array elements (opp order of most languages)

// Dictionaries (any type to any other type)
mapping (string =˃ uint) public balances;
balances["charles"] = 1;
// balances["ada"] result is 0, all non-set key values return zeroes
// 'public' allows following from another contract
contractName.balances("charles"); // returns 1
// 'public' created a getter (but not setter) like the following:
function balances(string _account) returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_account];
}

// Nested mappings
mapping (address =˃ mapping (address =˃ uint)) public custodians;

// To delete
delete balances["John"];
delete balances; // sets all elements to 0

// Unlike other languages, CANNOT iterate through all elements in
// mapping, without knowing source keys - can build data structure
// on top to do this

// Structs
struct Bank {
    address owner;
    uint balance;
}
Bank b = Bank({
    owner: msg.sender,
    balance: 5
});
// or
Bank c = Bank(msg.sender, 5);

c.balance = 5; // set to new value
delete b;
// sets to initial value, set all variables in struct to 0, except mappings

// Enums
enum State { Created, Locked, Inactive }; // often used for state machine
State public state; // Declare variable from enum
state = State.Created;
// enums can be explicitly converted to ints
uint createdState = uint(State.Created); //  0

// Data locations: Memory vs. storage vs. calldata - all complex types (arrays,
// structs) have a data location
// 'memory' does not persist, 'storage' does
// Default is 'storage' for local and state variables; 'memory' for func params
// stack holds small local variables

// for most types, can explicitly set which data location to use


// 3. Simple operators
// Comparisons, bit operators and arithmetic operators are provided
// exponentiation: **
// exclusive or: ^
// bitwise negation: ~


// 4. Global Variables of note
// ** this **
this; // address of contract
// often used at end of contract life to transfer remaining balance to party
this.balance;
this.someFunction(); // calls func externally via call, not via internal jump

// ** msg - Current message received by the contract ** **
msg.sender; // address of sender
msg.value; // amount of ether provided to this contract in wei, the function should be marked "payable"
msg.data; // bytes, complete call data
msg.gas; // remaining gas

// ** tx - This transaction **
tx.origin; // address of sender of the transaction
tx.gasprice; // gas price of the transaction

// ** block - Information about current block **
now; // current time (approximately), alias for block.timestamp (uses Unix time)
// Note that this can be manipulated by miners, so use carefully

block.number; // current block number
block.difficulty; // current block difficulty
block.blockhash(1); // returns bytes32, only works for most recent 256 blocks
block.gasLimit();

// ** storage - Persistent storage hash **
storage['abc'] = 'def'; // maps 256 bit words to 256 bit words


// 4. FUNCTIONS AND MORE
// A. Functions
// Simple function
function increment(uint x) returns (uint) {
    x += 1;
    return x;
}

// Functions can return many arguments, and by specifying returned arguments
// name don't need to explicitly return
function increment(uint x, uint y) returns (uint x, uint y) {
    x += 1;
    y += 1;
}
// Call previous functon
uint (a,b) = increment(1,1);

// 'view' (alias for 'constant')
// indicates that function does not/cannot change persistent vars
// View function execute locally, not on blockchain
// Noted: constant keyword will soon be deprecated.
uint y = 1;

function increment(uint x) view returns (uint x) {
    x += 1;
    y += 1; // this line would fail
    // y is a state variable, and can't be changed in a view function
}

// 'pure' is more strict than 'view' or 'constant', and does not
// even allow reading of state vars
// The exact rules are more complicated, so see more about
// view/pure:
// http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#view-functions

// 'Function Visibility specifiers'
// These can be placed where 'view' is, including:
// public - visible externally and internally (default for function)
// external - only visible externally (including a call made with this.)
// private - only visible in the current contract
// internal - only visible in current contract, and those deriving from it

// Generally, a good idea to mark each function explicitly

// Functions hoisted - and can assign a function to a variable
function a() {
    var z = b;
    b();
}

function b() {

}

// All functions that receive ether must be marked 'payable'
function depositEther() public payable {
    balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
}


// Prefer loops to recursion (max call stack depth is 1024)
// Also, don't setup loops that you haven't bounded,
// as this can hit the gas limit

// B. Events
// Events are notify external parties; easy to search and
// access events from outside blockchain (with lightweight clients)
// typically declare after contract parameters

// Typically, capitalized - and add Log in front to be explicit and prevent confusion
// with a function call

// Declare
event LogSent(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount); // note capital first letter

// Call
LogSent(from, to, amount);

/**

For an external party (a contract or external entity), to watch using
the Web3 Javascript library:

// The following is Javascript code, not Solidity code
Coin.LogSent().watch({}, '', function(error, result) {
    if (!error) {
        console.log("Coin transfer: " + result.args.amount +
            " coins were sent from " + result.args.from +
            " to " + result.args.to + ".");
        console.log("Balances now:\n" +
            "Sender: " + Coin.balances.call(result.args.from) +
            "Receiver: " + Coin.balances.call(result.args.to));
    }
}
**/

// Common paradigm for one contract to depend on another (e.g., a
// contract that depends on current exchange rate provided by another)

// C. Modifiers
// Modifiers validate inputs to functions such as minimal balance or user auth;
// similar to guard clause in other languages

// '_' (underscore) often included as last line in body, and indicates
// function being called should be placed there
modifier onlyAfter(uint _time) { require (now ˃= _time); _; }
modifier onlyOwner { require(msg.sender == owner) _; }
// commonly used with state machines
modifier onlyIfStateA (State currState) { require(currState == State.A) _; }

// Append right after function declaration
function changeOwner(newOwner)
onlyAfter(someTime)
onlyOwner()
onlyIfState(State.A)
{
    owner = newOwner;
}

// underscore can be included before end of body,
// but explicitly returning will skip, so use carefully
modifier checkValue(uint amount) {
    _;
    if (msg.value ˃ amount) {
        uint amountToRefund = amount - msg.value;
        msg.sender.transfer(amountToRefund);
    }
}


// 6. BRANCHING AND LOOPS

// All basic logic blocks work - including if/else, for, while, break, continue
// return - but no switch

// Syntax same as javascript, but no type conversion from non-boolean
// to boolean (comparison operators must be used to get the boolean val)

// For loops that are determined by user behavior, be careful - as contracts have a maximal
// amount of gas for a block of code - and will fail if that is exceeded
// For example:
for(uint x = 0; x < refundAddressList.length; x++) {
    refundAddressList[x].transfer(SOME_AMOUNT);
}

// Two errors above:
// 1. A failure on transfer stops the loop from completing, tying up money
// 2. This loop could be arbitrarily long (based on the amount of users who need refunds), and
// therefore may always fail as it exceeds the max gas for a block
// Instead, you should let people withdraw individually from their subaccount, and mark withdrawn
// e.g., favor pull payments over push payments


// 7. OBJECTS/CONTRACTS

// A. Calling external contract
contract InfoFeed {
    function info() payable returns (uint ret)  { return 42; }
}

contract Consumer {
    InfoFeed feed; // points to contract on blockchain

    // Set feed to existing contract instance
    function setFeed(address addr) {
        // automatically cast, be careful; constructor is not called
        feed = InfoFeed(addr);
    }

    function createNewFeed() {
        feed = new InfoFeed(); // new instance created; constructor called
    }

    function callFeed() {

        // custom ether value or gas
        feed.info.value(10).gas(800)();
    }
}

// B. Inheritance

// Order matters, last inherited contract (i.e., 'def') can override parts of
// previously inherited contracts
contract MyContract is abc, def("a custom argument to def") {

// Override function
    function z() {
        if (msg.sender == owner) {
            def.z(); // call overridden function from def
            super.z(); // call immediate parent overridden function
        }
    }
}

// abstract function
function someAbstractFunction(uint x);
// cannot be compiled, so used in base/abstract contracts
// that are then implemented

// C. Import

import "filename";
import "github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/library/iterable_mapping.sol";


// 8. OTHER KEYWORDS

// A. Selfdestruct
// selfdestruct current contract, sending funds to address (often creator)
selfdestruct(SOME_ADDRESS);

// removes storage/code from current/future blocks
// helps thin clients, but previous data persists in blockchain

// Common pattern, lets owner end the contract and receive remaining funds
function remove() {
    if(msg.sender == creator) { // Only let the contract creator do this
        selfdestruct(creator); // Makes contract inactive, returns funds
    }
}

// May want to deactivate contract manually, rather than selfdestruct
// (ether sent to selfdestructed contract is lost)


// 9. CONTRACT DESIGN NOTES

// A. Obfuscation
// All variables are publicly viewable on blockchain, so anything
// that is private needs to be obfuscated (e.g., hashed w/secret)

// Steps: 1. Commit to something, 2. Reveal commitment
keccak256("some_bid_amount", "some secret"); // commit

// call contract's reveal function in the future
// showing bid plus secret that hashes to SHA3
reveal(100, "mySecret");

// B. Storage optimization
// Writing to blockchain can be expensive, as data stored forever; encourages
// smart ways to use memory (eventually, compilation will be better, but for now
// benefits to planning data structures - and storing min amount in blockchain)

// Cost can often be high for items like multidimensional arrays
// (cost is for storing data - not declaring unfilled variables)

// C. Data access in blockchain
// Cannot restrict human or computer from reading contents of
// transaction or transaction's state

// While 'private' prevents other *contracts* from reading data
// directly - any other party can still read data in blockchain

// All data to start of time is stored in blockchain, so
// anyone can observe all previous data and changes

// D. Cron Job
// Contracts must be manually called to handle time-based scheduling; can create external
// code to regularly ping, or provide incentives (ether) for others to

// E. Observer Pattern
// An Observer Pattern lets you register as a subscriber and
// register a function which is called by the oracle (note, the oracle pays
// for this action to be run)
// Some similarities to subscription in Pub/sub

// This is an abstract contract, both client and server classes import
// the client should implement
contract SomeOracleCallback {
    function oracleCallback(int _value, uint _time, bytes32 info) external;
}

contract SomeOracle {
    SomeOracleCallback[] callbacks; // array of all subscribers

    // Register subscriber
    function addSubscriber(SomeOracleCallback a) {
        callbacks.push(a);
    }

    function notify(value, time, info) private {
        for(uint i = 0;i < callbacks.length; i++) {
            // all called subscribers must implement the oracleCallback
            callbacks[i].oracleCallback(value, time, info);
        }
    }

    function doSomething() public {
        // Code to do something

        // Notify all subscribers
        notify(_value, _time, _info);
    }
}

// Now, your client contract can addSubscriber by importing SomeOracleCallback
// and registering with Some Oracle

// Currency units
// Currency is defined using wei, smallest unit of Ether
uint minAmount = 1 wei;
uint a = 1 finney; // 1 ether == 1000 finney
// Other units, see: http://ether.fund/tool/converter

// Time units
1 == 1 second
1 minutes == 60 seconds

// Can multiply a variable times unit, as units are not stored in a variable
uint x = 5;
(x * 1 days); // 5 days

// Careful about leap seconds/years with equality statements for time
// (instead, prefer greater than/less than)

// Cryptography
// All strings passed are concatenated before hash action
sha3("ab", "cd");
ripemd160("abc");
sha256("def");

// 11. SECURITY

// Bugs can be disastrous in Ethereum contracts - and even popular patterns in Solidity,
// may be found to be antipatterns

// See security links at the end of this doc

// 12. LOW LEVEL FUNCTIONS
// call - low level, not often used, does not provide type safety
successBoolean = someContractAddress.call('function_name', 'arg1', 'arg2');

// callcode - Code at target address executed in *context* of calling contract
// provides library functionality
someContractAddress.callcode('function_name');


// 13. STYLE NOTES
// Based on Python's PEP8 style guide
// Full Style guide: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html

// Quick summary:
// 4 spaces for indentation
// Two lines separate contract declarations (and other top level declarations)
// Avoid extraneous spaces in parentheses
// Can omit curly braces for one line statement (if, for, etc)
// else should be placed on own line


// 14. NATSPEC COMMENTS
// used for documentation, commenting, and external UIs

// Contract natspec - always above contract definition
/// @title Contract title
/// @author Author name

// Function natspec
/// @notice information about what function does; shown when function to execute
/// @dev Function documentation for developer

// Function parameter/return value natspec
/// @param someParam Some description of what the param does
/// @return Description of the return value

<span xsmall>Retrieve events quickly</span>
- Imagine theºcommon problemº:
  - A given contract emits a given event sparsely, with
    an average of 1 event each 10.000 blocks.
  - We want to retrieve all events.
  - By default the client needs to query from block-zero
    to latest block. This can means query-times of more than
    a minute even in dedicated hardware.
 ºSOLUTIONº:
  - Save as contract state the block when an event has been
    emitted.
    The on the event add the information for the previous
    block where such event was emitted.
  - On client code run backward from last-to-first even
    using the state to retrieve the latest block, and then
    the event information to "jump" to the previous block.

- With msg.sender the owner can be a contract.
- With tx.origin the owner can never be a contract.
  In a simple call chain A→B→C→D,  inside D msg.sender will be C, and tx.origin will be A.

- msg.sender is preferred for the flexibility it provides.
  Furthermore, for Serenity, even though it's a while out, Vitalik
  recommends avoiding tx.origin: How do I make my DAPP "Serenity-Proof?"
- Carefully consider if you really ever need to use tx.origin.

<span xsmall>ERROR CONTROL</span>
@[https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions]

BºError Management:º
  - Solidity uses state-reverting ("rollback") exceptions to handle errors:
    Capturing ("try-catching") Exceptions IS NOT POSSIBLE:
      EVM rollbacks any stat change in current call and all its sub/super-calls
     ºincluding any events emitted up until the rollback.º
      (there is no safe way to continue execution while warrantying atomicity
       and reproducibility of results)
  - TX is still mined and TXReceipt status flaged with "fail" error, but
    the execution of the mined will not modify any state. TX will just consume

  └ºassert( "my code-logic assertion");º
    - Represent a condition that must never happen unless
      there has been a solidity programming error.
    - Check for conditions and throw an exception
      if the condition is not met
    - Should only be used to test for internal
      errors, and to check invariants
    - If used properly, analysis tools can
      evaluate your contract to identify
      the conditions and function calls which will
      reach a failing assert.
      Properly functioning code should never reach
      a failing assert statement
    - compiles to INVALID 0xfe instruction
    - TheºEVM automatically raise assert-like exceptionsºwhen
      - access array at index greater than array length (or negative)
      - access fixed-length bytes"N" at a too large or negative index
      - divide or modulo by zero (ex.: 5 / 0 , 23 % 0)
      - shift by a negative amount
      - convert a value too big|negative into an enum type
      - call to zero-initialized variable of internal function type

    - pre/post check in in/out-data to function
    - Check for conditions and throw an exception
      if the condition is not met
    - Should be used to ensure valid conditions,
      such as inputs, or contract state variables
      are met, or to validate return values from
      calls to external contracts
    - optionally a message-string can be provided
    - compiles to REVER 0xfd instruction

      call a function via a message call but it does not
      finish properly (i.e. it runs out of gas, has no
      matching function, or throws an exception itself),
      except when a low level operation call, send,
      delegatecall or callcode is used.

  └ if ("business condtion")ºrevert("error message");º
    - business logic exceptions, like invalid request
      for current state.
    - can be used to flag an error and revert the
      current call.
    - It is possible to provide a string message
      containing details about the error that will
      be passed back to the caller.

    -BºDo not consume gas(v.Metrópolis+)º (Re-check this claim)

RºWARNº: low level ops return false, no assert/require/revert exception is raised.
   Example of low levels conditions returning false:
   (or true when called account is non-existent,
    Existence must be checked prior to call)
   - create a contract using "new" but contract creation does not finish properly.
   - perform external function call targeting a contract that contains no code
   - contract receives Ether via public function without payable modifier
     (including constructor or fallback)
   - contract receives Ether via public getter function
   - .transfer() fails

☞ Solidity compiler automatically generate exceptions (assert or require/revert?) if:
  - If your contract receives Ether via a public function without payable modifier
    (including the constructor and the fallback function)
  - If your contract receives Ether via a public getter function
  - If you call a zero-initialized variable of internal function type
  - If a addressInstance.transfer() fails
  - The provided string in require/revert will be abi-encoded as if it
    were a call to a function Error(string). Ex:
    revert("Not enough Ether provided.");

Bºrevert reasonº
  Since Solidity 0.4.22 the require() and revert() operation optionally
  take a revert reason as argument: Revert with reason.
  This is accessible for eth_calls in the result field.

  Clients libraries will eventually support fetching such value.
  Ex: web3j REF: @[https://github.com/web3j/web3j/issues/858]

  Have a method public String getRevertReason() on
  org.web3j.protocol.core.methods.response.EthCall that retrieves
  that revert reason.

  See also (future/rejected?) proposal Typed Errors EIP 838
  @[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838].
  Ex of proposal:
  contract MyToken {
   ºerror InsufficientFunds(uint256 amount, uint256 balance);º // ← Strongly typed error

    function ... {
      if (! "assertCondition")
         throw InsufficientFunds(_amount, balances[msg.sender]);
      ...
    }
    ...
  }

  @[https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Send-Transactions/Revert-Reason/]

  besu requires the flag '--revert-reason-enabled' to include the revert reason in
  the TX receipt
  Rº: It may use a significant amount of memory when connected to public  netsº

  - When revert reason is enabled, the revert reason is included as an
   ABI-encoded string in the transaction receipt returned by eth_getTransactionReceipt.

  RºImportantº:
    revert reason is not included in the transactions receipts root hash.
    This means that the revert reason is only available to nodes that execute the
    transaction when importing the block.  That is, the revert reason is
  RºNOT available if using fast syncº

<span xsmall>Signature Verif.</span>
@[https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/utilities]
ºChecking Signatures On-Chainº

- ECDSA provides functions for recovering and managing Ethereum account
  ECDSA signatures. These are often generated via web3.eth.sign, and
  are a 65 byte array (of type bytes in Solidity) arranged the follwing
  way: [[v (1)], [r (32)], [s (32)]].

- The data signer can be recovered with ECDSA.recover, and its address
  compared to verify the signature. Most wallets will hash the data to
  sign and add the prefix '\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n', so when
  attempting to recover the signer of an Ethereum signed message hash,
  you’ll want to use toEthSignedMessageHash.

RºWARNº:
- Getting signature verification right is not trivial: make sure you
  fully read and understand ECDSA's documentation.

<span xsmall>Diamon Standard</span>
- New Diamon Standard for Compiler aware upgradability of contracts using facets !!!!
  by Nick Mudge


- Ethereum's Maximum Contract Size Limit is Solved with the Diamond Standard.
@[https://dev.to/mudgen/ethereum-s-maximum-contract-size-limit-is-solved-with-the-diamond-standard-2189]

  - Ethereum contracts with too many functions and too much code will hit
    the maximum contract size limit of 24KB.

  - Also it is easier and more flexible to access and modify contract storage
    if state and functions are kept together under the same Ethereum address.

  BºSolution: Proxy contracts:º
    BºStay small by borrowing functions from other contracts using aº
    Bºlow level operation called "delegatecall".                    º
    OºDiamon Standard is about standarizing the way to do it.º
      It standardizes how you can create a small contract that can
      utilize the code of any number of other contracts as if it is
      its own code.

    - A contract implementing the Standard is called a Oºdiamondº,
      to from regular contracts and also from proxy contracts that
      can only borrow code from a single contract.

    - A real diamond has sides called facets, from each of the
      other contracts that it borrows functions from.

    - The Diamond Standard extends the analogy to its "diamondCut"
      function which is used to add/replace/remove/facets and functions.
      (analogous with a real diamond new facets by literally
       cutting it).

    - "The Loupe" : 4 standards functions returning information about
                    what facets and functions exist in a diamond.

    -BºDiamond Standard provides also a flexible and transparent method º
     Bºfor creating upgradeable diamonds.º


(EIP-2535) for upgrading contracts.

A number of individuals and companies have contacted me and told me
they are using diamonds or are implementing diamonds for their
systems. Here is some information from some of them who have publicly
written about it:

VolleyFire, a liquidity provider for decentralized exchanges is using
diamonds.

Joey Zacherl, a developer at VolleyFire, released a Python tool
called Diamond Setter that is a contract manager for diamonds. Here
is his blog post about it: Diamond Setter, Ethereum smart contract
manager

Ronan Sandford (wighawag), a prominent smart contract developer and
an author of the ERC-1155 standard, announced he is working on adding
support for diamonds to buidler-deploy to make it very easy to
deploy/cut diamonds. buidler-deploy is a mechanism to deploy
contracts to any network, keeping track of them and replicating the
same environment for testing.

Nayms is using diamonds in production. Ram wrote a blog post about
their implementation: Upgradeable smart contracts using the Diamond
Standard

The Diamond Standard got its first popular Reddit post.

<span xsmall>Multikey map how-to:</span>
@[https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/69727/map-multikey-how-to]

BºAlt1: create key like hash of N composing keysº

  event LogSet(bytes32 key1, bytes32 key2, bytes32 hashedKey);
  bytes32 hashOfMultiKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(key1,key2));

  LogSet event ensure observers have a way to discover all A/B
  combinations that have ever been used, so it's perfectly reasonable
  to ask for them in a get() function.
  RºWARNº:  contract itself wouldn't be able to enumerate them.
  It would rely on external inputs and then perform the multikey
  computation.

BºAlt2: Map of Mapº
mapping(
  bytes32            /*key1*/ =
    mapping( bytes32 /*key2*/
      =˃ bytes32)
);
// "counter-intuitively" no storage cost
// is  associated to store a mapping inside
// a mapping.

Have a look at this library for a way to treat all of your keys as
members of sets with a remove capability. This would enable support
of "is A in B?" and "is B in A?" and the ability to logically remove
members.

      return values[multikey(keyA, keyB)];
  }

  // This remove function will reject removing a key pair that does
  // not exist
  function remove(bytes32 keyA, bytes32 keyB) public {
    bInA[keyA].remove(keyB);
    aInB[keyB].remove(keyA);

  // Check existance
  function isBInA(bytes32 keyA, bytes32 keyB) public view

    return bInA[keyA].exists(keyB);
  }

  function isAInB(bytes32 keyA, bytes32 keyB) public view
  returns(bool isIndeed) {
    return aInB[keyB].exists(keyA);
  }

  // So clients can enumerate keys, all B in A, and all A in B
  function countBinA(bytes32 keyA) public view returns(uint) {
    return bInA[keyA].count();
  }

  function countAinB(bytes32 keyB) public view returns(uint) {
    return aInB[keyB].count();

  function bAAtIndex(bytes32 keyB, uint row) public view
  returns(bytes32 keyA) {

This example is probably more ambitious than actually required.
Hopefully it shows how a variety of concerns can be addressed while
observing the ideals of strict enforcement of relational integrity
and fully discoverable internal structure.

Hope it helps.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 - We now have a directly addressable and fully iterable storage structure, which is
   not just a Double Linked List but a Circular Double Linked List by default
   with the head at 0x0. This gives us two very desirable properties for free...

 - FIFO and FILO Queues
    First In First Out (FIFO) and First In Last Out (FILO) queues are a very
    common concept in computing. FIFO can be used for task queues while FILO
    is also used for memory 'stacks'.

 - FIFO's can be used in any contracts that require atomic sequential order
   processing. Here a new order is simply inserted previous to the head,
   while the oldest order is simply taken from next to the head. No search
   loops required.

 - If you think these structures might be useful, check out my Circular
   Double Linked List Index Library which is used by my Intrinsically
   Tradable Tokens (ITT) contract.

ºSTATIC ANALYSISº
- Smart Contract Analysis types:

 STEP 1      STEP 2       STEP 3        STEP 4        STEP 5 @1
────────    ──────────   ───────────   ─────────   ───────────────────────
Solidity    compiler     Recover       functions   known attacks detection
Source   →  sol       →  meaninful   → modifiers →
Code        --ast-json   information   variables   Gas optimizer linters
                         from          ...
                         ast-tree
────────    ──────────   ───────────   ─────────   ───────────────────────

@1: STEP 5: STATIC CODE ANALYSIS
(Find bugs that the standar compiler is not able to detect)

  KNOW ATTACKS TESTS                SEVERITY LEVEL
  -----------------------------     --------------
  - Reentrancy                      - High
  - uninitialized states            - Medium
  - unused internal functions       - Low
  - Functions Transferring ethers   - Informational
    (check modifiers/authenticity)
  - Ether lock
  - Gas optimization etc.


STATIC CODE ANALYSIS LIMITATIONS:
- It is not a complete security tool.
- Only known attacks or predefined rules
  can be scanned.

ºDYNAMIC ANALYSISº
- Dyn.Ana. tests the code in a run-time setup
- Dummy (or boundary) values are taken as input
  according to the conditions of function.

- Most of the dynamic analysis tools use:
  - symbolic analysis
  - fuzzers
  - formal verification to secure smart contract.

-ºsymbolic analysisº
 means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs
 cause each part of a program function to execute.

ºCompared to traditional functional testingº
- function "input values" are used to test function i.e ‘123’, ‘Hello’ concrete values,
- Symbolic analysis: no specific input is taken at present but a default value:
  - let's say ƛ is taken as an input after reaching at conditional statement it fork
    the state and two different values are taken.

Ex: Our goal will be to see if we can use symbolic analysis
    to show that it is possible to get the result of the next function
    to be 100.

 01 function test(uint256 value) public pure returns(int) {
 02   uint result = 0;
 03   if (value ˃ 100) {
 04     result += 100;
 05   }
 06   return result;
 07 }

  NORMAL DYNAMIC TESTING  | SYMBOLIC ANALYSIS
  (input = 50)            | (input = ƛ)
--------------------------+-------------------------
  value  = 50 (line 1)    |        value  =  ƛ (line 1)
                          |
  value  = 50 (line 2)    |        value  =  ƛ (line 2)
  result =  0             |        result =  0
                          |
  value  = 50 (line 3)    |        value  =  ƛ (line 3)
  result =  0             |        result =  0
                          |
  value  = 50 (line 7)    | value  =  ƛ (line 7)       value  = ƛ    (line 4)
 ºresult =  0º            |ºresult =  0 if ƛ˂=100º     result = 100  if ƛ˃100
                          |
                          |                            value  = ƛ    (line 7)
                          |                           ºresult = 100º if ƛ˃100



ºwe use symbolic analysis to find the input values to execute functionº
 input_list [ ˂=100, ˃100 ]

-ºFUZZING SMART CONTRACTº
- Type of testing in which seed inputs or set of inputs are taken
  to discover new inputs automatically  that might highlight coding
  errors or security loopholes in smart contracts, by inputting
  invalid or random data called FUZZ to the smart contract.
  After which the smart contracts are monitored for various path
  generated or error handling.

   Fuzzing      Vulnerability

- fuzzer can be classified into three categories based
  on testing techniques:
   -  Black box testing
     ºThe fuzzer didn't get any information about the contractº
      performing millions of mutants( inputs ) while testing
      a smart contract.
      - PROS:
        - Millions of input values in few seconds is used to
          find loopholes in smart contracts.
      - CONS:
        - statement or code coverage is "random"

   -  White box testing
     ºfuzzer have information about smart contracts input valuesº
      They use symbolic analysis to test smart contracts,
      - PROS:
        - cover most of the paths
        - It wil use multiple searching techniques to
          generate new paths like heuristic searching technique.
   -  Grey box testing
     ºfuzzer has partial knowledge of smart contractsº
      They are the most popular fuzzers in finding the
      vulnerability of smart contracts.
      - lightweight testing approach that effectively
        detects bugs and security vulnerabilities.
      - greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs
        to exercise new paths; this makes it challenging
        to cover code that is guarded by complex checks
      - PROS:
        - cover most of the paths
Grey box Fuzzing and formal verification are a very popular way to
secure smart contracts these days but didn’t get the edge yet,
tools under these techniques are still under development or not
production-ready.

TODO: In upcoming articles, we will discuss what is formal verification
      and how formal verification can help in securing smart contracts.

FORMAL Verification
https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle
https://github.com/pirapira/ethereum-formal-verification-overview
Why3 Solidity
Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification. It provides a rich
language for specification and programming, called WhyML, and relies on
external theorem provers, both automated and interactive, to discharge
verification conditions. (See the specific section below for the list of
supported provers.) Why3 comes with a standard library of logical theories (
integer and real arithmetic, Boolean operations, sets and maps, etc.) and
basic programming data structures (arrays, queues, hash tables, etc.). A user
can write WhyML programs directly and get correct-by-construction OCaml
programs through an automated extraction mechanism. WhyML is also used as an
intermediate language for the verification of C, Java, or Ada programs. (See
Projects using Why3 below.) Why3 can be easily extended with support for new
theorem provers. Why3 can be used as a software library, through an OCaml API.

https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/3779/formal-verification-for-solidity-contracts

"""
   We just merged a first pull request that allows Solidity contracts to be
   formally verified using a toolkit called why3.
   This means that a computer creates and checks a mathematical proof of
   assertions about the behaviour of the contract.
   Only a small subset of Solidity is supported for now, but that makes it
   already possible to verify a recursive binary search routine on arrays:
   https://gist.github.com/chriseth/0c671e0dac08c3630f47
"""

"""
   How to use it on the example
   The solidity compiler (only solc at latest develop for now) can translate the
   source code into a different programming language which can be understood by
   why3 (the language is a dialect of ocaml). To do that, call it as ""solc \-\-
   formal -o /tmp/output_directory/ source.sol"". Furthermore, using special
   tags in the Solidity comments of the form ""///@why3 ..."" you can formulate
   assertions and requirements that can be understood by the why3 framework and
   will be literally inserted into the generated code.


   start a graphical version of the toolkit and perform the verification.

   How to install why3
   I am not aware of any binary packages, so you have to download the source
   from the website.  As why3 itself is only a frontend to the real workhorses,
   the provers, you need to install a prover. I tried ""alt-ergo"" and Z3 - the
   first is part of the ubuntu distribution, the second has binaries for most
   platforms.

   After installing the prover (and making sure it is in the PATH), call ""why3
   config \-\-detect"" and it should detect your prover. """""""

Moonad Roadmap
2018 Main Accomplishments:
  - Designed the first version of Formality with the aim of
    developing an efficient proof language for smart-contracts and
    applications. It included native datatypes and a prototypal
    interaction-net compiler.
  - Designed Symmetric Interaction Calculus, a parallel model of
    computation with applications to efficient, optimal and parallel
    evaluation of functional programs.
  - Explored it and wrote a blog post detailing our insights.

2019 Q1 Accomplishments
  - Implemented and explored Cedille-Core, a minimal proof language designed by Aaron Stump.
  - Based on it, developed a 800 LOC type-theory compatible with optimal reductions,
    previously called Formality, which we now call Elementary Affine Type Theory (EA-TT).
  - Based on Symmetric Interaction Combinators, developed Elementary Affine Net
    (EA-Net), an interaction net system and compile target for EA-TT.
  - [Stated and proved several theorems on EA-TT](proofs and libraries), to validate
    and explore its expressivity.
    Wrote a blog post introducing it.
  - Started working on the Moonad Operating System, bu
    t stopped to focus in developing an efficient proof language.
  - Started a compiler to the EVM.
  - Developed a HTML/JS animation tool for EA-Net.

2019 Q2 Accomplishments
  - Developed Elementary-Affine-Core (EA-TT), the untyped version of EA-TT.
  - Restructured Formality (the typed proof language) into many sub-projects:
  - Wrote several FM-Core libraries, including:
  - Finished the EA-Net-˃EVM compiler. Still needs optimizations. FM-Net next.
  - A prototypal C-backend for FM-Net. (Soon we'll have C++/LLVM experts optimizing it!)
  - Wrote a Github Wiki for Formality-Core.

Current Status (updated: June 22, 2019)
  - focus in graduating from the EF and creating our own company.
   ... Our mission will be to develop Formality as an efficient,
       user-friendly proof language suitable to write smart-contracts,
       graphical applications, servers and so on ...

<span xsmall>fixing "stack too deep" error</span>
- In practice:
  Problem: Compiler tries to access a variable var1 that is beyond "16 depth in stack".
           Compilation fails with error "stack too deep"

  Solution: ("Patchy" but works).
           When var1 is still accesible, copy it again to var1_clone like
           function vote(uint var1, ..., ... ,....)  {
              ...
              uint var1_clone = var1;
              ...
              someMap[var1_clone] = ...; // ← At this point var1_clone is still on the stack
                                              but var1 is "too far away"
           }

  FUNCTION
  STACK FRAME
  -----------
- local var3  ←  Copy, for. ex, input arg1 here to have access once stacks grows "too much"
- local var2
- local var1
...
─ input  arg3 ┐  Created at function call. Since those are the deepest in
─ input  arg2 ├─ the stack, they are the fist to cause "stack too deep" problems
─ input  arg1 ┘
- 'return address' ← where to return from function

  -ºOpcodes use arguments at different levels in the stack. Deeper levels are pushed first.º
   ºIf an argument is pushed after another, it should appear in the function signature     º
   ºafter the former as well, otherwise it would push the other one down the               º
   ºstack before it could be used.                                                         º

RºWARN:º (@[https://blog.aventus.io/stack-too-deep-error-in-solidity-5b8861891bae])
Rº"...more difficult cases arise when calling functions in otherº
Rº contracts or librariesº, since the opcodes CALL and DELEGATECALL take
   7 or 6 input arguments each, with a lot more possibilities of
   interaction between the opcode and function arguments..."

<span xspan>Universal Token</span>
  "A Unique Standard for Centralized and Decentralized Finance Use Cases"

  Thus far in the Ethereum space, theºERC20 and ERC1400 tokens have set º
 ºthe standards for token functionality within both decentralized º
 ºfinance and also more centralized financial industry use cases.ºToday
  we introduce the evolution in token standards: The Universal Token
  for Assets and Payments, a token designed to accommodate a much wider
  range of use cases.

BºThe modularity of the Universal Token for Assets and Payments will    º
Bºenable both enterprises and developers to issue ANY type of asset, be º
Bºit a DeFi derivative, loan or mortgage, a retail or wholesale CBDC,   º
Bºany type of financial instrument, an invoice, contract, or even       º
Bºcollectible, or gaming asset. The Universal Token for Assets and      º
BºPayments includes several new features that can easily be activated   º
Bºor deactivated depending on use case. It is compatible with ERC20 and º
BºERC1400, and was inspired by ERC2020 and Hash Time Locked Contract    º
Bº(HTLC) implementations.                                               º

 ºdifferent walletsº will understand out-of-the-box. A list of
  ERC20 compliant wallets can be found at:
@[https://tokenmarket.net/what-is/ethereum-token-wallets/]
<hr/>

<span xsmall>ERC-777</span>
- This standard defines a new way to interact with a token contract
  while remaining backward compatible with ERC20.

- It defines advanced features to interact with tokens. Namely,
  operators to send tokens on behalf of another address—contract or
  regular account—and send/receive hooks to offer token holders more
  control over their tokens.

- It takes advantage of ERC1820 to find out whether and where to
  notify contracts and regular addresses when they receive tokens as
  well as to allow compatibility with already-deployed contracts.

<span xsmall>ERC-1400</span>
- library of standards for security tokens on Ethereum.

  In aggregate provides a suite of standard interfaces for issuing /
  redeeming security tokens, managing their ownership and transfer
  restrictions and providing transparency to token holders on how
  different subsets of their token balance behave with Bºrespect to º
Bºtransfer restrictions, rights and obligations.º

  - Standards should be backwards compatible with ERC-20 (#20) and
    easily extended to be compatible with ERC-777 (#777).

  - Depends on:
    - ERC-1410: differentiated ownership / transparent restrictions
    - ERC-1594: on-chain restriction checking with error
                signalling, off-chain data injection for transfer restrictions and
                issuance / redemption semantics

- In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity
  whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.

- Some new blockchain games are now also using the more recent
  ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token standard which allows each unit to be
  a unique collectible item with its own serial number.
  These have become popular in some early blockchain games because
  of the success of CryptoKitties.

- Evolved Token for Mainstream Games
  - Multiplayer Games Have LOTS of Items
    - Runescape has 35,000
    - World of Warcraft has over 100,000 different items!
    - Shooters like Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 each
      have thousands of skins and items.

-ºThe biggest problem with existing token designs is that they    º
 ºrequire deploying a separate contract to the blockchain for eachº
 ºand every item type!                                            º
  - EnjinX, our upcoming blockchain explorer, has logged transfers
    from over 74,000 different tokens deployed on Ethereum since 2015.

- ERC-1155 takes a new approach to defining tokens. Items are now
  stored in a single contract with the minimum possible amount of
  data needed to distinguish the token from other ones.
  The contract state contains configuration data per Token ID and
  all the behavior governing the collection with
 ºAtomic Swaps amongst different itemsº

  Atomic Swap ussage examples:
  - Multi-Transfers
    Imagine checking out your groceries at the store and having
    to buy each item in your cart separately.
    This is how ERC-20 and ERC-721 token transfers work,
    it’s just not efficient.
  - In ERC-1155, you can send any number of items to one or
    multiple recipients in a single transaction. This reduces gas
    and congestion on the Ethereum transaction pool

  - The transfer, approve, melt, and trade functions all take
    arrays as parameters, which let you perform between 100–200
    such operations in a single transaction.

- ERC-20 is limited to fungibles, ERC-721 is limited to contracts
  with individual unique copies of items. The two token types are
  not very compatible or mixable.

  ERC-1155 Crypto Items improve on this by combining the benefits
  of both.

<span xsmall>ERC 777: Advanced Token Standar</span>
@[https://medium.com/coinmonks/erc-777-a-new-advanced-token-standard-c841788ab3cb]

A New Advanced Token Standard was introduced to establish an evolved
Token standard which learned from misconceptions like approve() with
a value and the aforementioned send-tokens-to-contract-issue.

Additionally, the ERC-777 uses the new standard ERC-820:
Pseudo-introspection using a registry contract which allows for
registering meta-data for contracts to provide a simple type of
introspection. This allows for backwards compatibility and other
functionality extensions, depending on the ITokenRecipient returned
by a EIP-820 lookup on the to address, and the functions implemented
by the target contract.

ERC-777 adds a lot of learnings from using ERC-20 Tokens, eg.
white-listed operators, providing Ether-compliant interfaces with
send(…), using the ERC-820 to override and adapt functionality for
backwards compatibility.

ERC-725 Identity Std: TODO:
@[https://erc725alliance.org/]
- What is ERC 725?
  ERC 725 is a proposed standard for blockchain-based identity
  authored by Fabian Vogelsteller, creator of ERC 20 and Web3.js. ERC
  725 describes proxy smart contracts that can be controlled by
  multiple keys and other smart contracts. ERC 735 is an associated
  standard to add and remove claims to an ERC 725 identity smart
  contract. These identity smart contracts can describe humans, groups
  , objects, and machines. ERC 725 lives on the Ethereum
  blockchain.


- Why ERC 725?
  ERC 725 allows for self-sovereign identity. Users should be able to
  own and manage their identity instead of ceding ownership of
  identity to centralized organizations. We have seen the negative
  effects of having centralized identity with damaging leaks and
  unfair selling of user data and identity. An open, portable
  standard for identities will enable decentralized reputation,
  governance, and more. Users will be able to take their identity
  across different Dapps and platforms that support this standard.

<pre zoom  labels="101">
<span xsmall>About Libraries:</span>
@[https://blog.aragon.one/library-driven-development-in-solidity-2bebcaf88736]
Library benefits:
  - saving substantial amounts of gas
  - can make for a more secure environment (if reused libraries are audited).

- In Solidity, a library is a different type of contract
  (library myLib {...} vs contract myContract {...}) ,
  doesn't have any storage and cannot hold ether:
  - It doesn't allow payable functions and cannot have a
    fallback function, enforced by the compiler.

- It can be seen as a sort of a singleton in the EVM:
  a piece of code that can be called from any contract
  without the need to deploy it again.

- It can also be seen as implicit base contracts of
   the contracts that use them

- EVM DELEGATECALL instruction is used to call the function,
  causing the calling context to be passed to the library,
  as if it was code running in the contract itself.

  context kept by library:
  | this       ← address of the contract invoquing the library not the
  |              library context
  | msg.sender ← sender address sing
  | msg.value
  | msg.sig
  | msg.data
  | msg.gas

 - Library ºlinkingº happens at the bytecode level (compile
   phase) and not at storage level so once setted it's lined
   for always:

   When contract A is compiled, it leaves a Oºplaceholderº for
   the library address in this way:

    0073Oº__ºCOº_____________________________________º630dbe671f
        Oº  ºCOº                                     º  ^^^^^^^
        Oº  ºCOº                                     º  0dbe671f is the function
        Oº  ºCOº                                     º  signature for a()

    * At compile time (before deploying the contract) the placeholder must be
      replaced with the address of the deployed library in the blockchain.


PROBLEM With Events sent by Libraries:
  Only problem is, right now (March 2017), the contract ABI does
  not reflect the events that the libraries it uses may emit.
   This confuses clients such as web3, that won't be able to
  decode what event was called or figure out how to decode its
  arguments.

HACK:  defining the event both in the contract and the library
  will trick clients into thinking that it was actually the
  main contract who sent the event and not the library.

@[https://hack.aragon.org/docs/apm.html]
- As a DAO, each aragonPM registry includes a number of installed applications,
  including one APMRegistry, one ENSSubdomainRegistrar, and many Repo instances.

<span xsmall>AragonOS</span>
@[https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-intro.html]
aragonOS provides the following functionality:
- DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organization

- Upgreadability: Smart contracts can be upgraded to a newer version.
   Example: fixing a bug or adding a feature.
- Permission control: By using the auth() and authP() modifiers you can
  protect functionality such that they're only accessible by other apps or
  entities if given permission. This completely abstracts the authentication
  logic from an app, allowing you to focus on your app's business logic.
  Example: protecting a vault so only the organization's Voting app can
  initiate an action to transfer funds.
- Forwarders: aragonOS apps can communicate with each other by sending their
  intent to perform an action to other apps. Example: withdrawing funds from
  a vault only on the passing of a vote and the expiring of a time-lock.

- All the above makes it very simple for aragonOS apps to incorporate governance.
  You just need to add a voting app, configure permissions the right way, and
  away you go!

ZeppelinOS "zos" is a command line tool to makes writing upgradeable contracts extremely easy, abstracting away the complexities of upgradeability.
 It is based on proxy libraries as explained <a TODO href="https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/proxy-libraries-in-solidity-79fbe4b970fd">[here]</a>

WARN: Upgradeability can NOT be applied to already-deployed contracts.

ºzos installº
$ npm install --global zos

ºzos ussageº
$ mkdir zos-demo ⅋⅋ cd zos-demo
$ npm init -y
$ zos init zos-demo  # create the zos.json config. file
                                  ^^^^^^^^
                              config file that makes zos
                              aware of your smart contract
                              architecture.

$ npm install --save zos-lib # A "contracts" folder is created

$ vim contracts/CounterContract.sol
 pragma solidity ^0.4.21;
 import "zos-lib/contracts/migrations/Migratable.sol";

 | contract CounterContract is Migratable {
 |
 |   uint256 public counter;
 |
 |   // ºinitialize replaces constructor in upgradable contractº
 |   // guaranting that the new contract version can only be initialized once.
 |   function Oºinitializeº(uint256 _counter)
 |     // isInitializer takes the name of contract and version ID
 |     ºisInitializer("CounterContract", "0")º public {
 |     counter = _counter;
 |   }
 |
 |   function increment() public {
 |     counter += 1;
 |   }
 | }
 |
 Note: If you do use a constructor in an upgradeable smart contract,
       everything you set in the constructor will be ignored.


ºTestingº
("npm install --save ganache-cli" if not already done)
$ npx ganache-cli --port 9545

$ zos add CounterContract  # ← STEP 1: Add smart contract to zos
$ zos push --network local # ← STEP 2: push it to the local network:

$ zos create CounterContract \ # create&amp;initialize upgradeable instance
      --init Oºinitializeº \
      --args 42 \     ← must match the Oºinitializeº method.
      --network local
→ ...
→ ... GºCounterContract proxy: ˂address˃º  ← address to use for instance
→ ...                                                  (safe somewhere safely!)

$ npx truffle console --network=local  # ← enter truffle interactive console
  truffle˃ counterContract = CounterContract.deployed()    # Alt 1:
  truffle˃ counterContract = CounterContract.at("address") # Alt 2:
  truffle˃ counterContract.increment()                     # Call public method
  truffle˃ counterContract.counter().then(counter =˃ counter.toNumber()) # Fetch value
  → 43
  truffle˃ .exit

ºUpgrade deployed contractº
  (add incrementByTwo and history map)

    pragma solidity ^0.4.21;
    import "zos-lib/contracts/migrations/Migratable.sol";

    contract CounterContract is Migratable {
     uint256 public counter;
 +  mapping(uint256 =˃ address) public history;
    ...

 +  function incrementByTwo() public {
 +     counter += 2;
 +     history[counter] = msg.sender;
 +   }
    }
RºWARN: When writing new versions of your contract, you must preserve all variables thatº
Rº      appear in previous versions of your smart contract in the same order.           º
Rº      You should only make additive changes.                                          º

$ zos push --network local                    # ← Push new version.
$ zos update CounterContract --network local  # ← update CounterContract to new version

ºTest new versionº
$ npx truffle console --network=local to access the truffle console.
   truffle˃ counterContract = CounterContract.deployed() # alt 1
   truffle˃ counterContract = CounterContract.at("address")
   truffle˃ counterContract.incrementByTwo()
   truffle˃ counterContract.counter().then(counter =˃ counter.toNumber())
   → 45
   truffle counterContract.history(45)
   → 0x....

ºNote: If at any point you’ve stopped Ganache and need to restart this process all over,  º
ºmake sure you delete zos.local.json file as well. This isn’t a problem for other networksº
ºsince typically networks don’t get wiped out :)º

RºWARN,WARN,WARN:º (Update 2019-12) Metamask management problems:
   @[https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/79962/updated-metamask-contributor-says-project-lacks-support-consensys]
   - A contributor of major Ethereum browser extension Metamask has
     reported that the MetaMask team is “totally overwhelmed” and not
     being prioritized by its parent company ConsenSys.

     The post, titled “Help MetaMask out of its Activity-Trap,” goes
     on to say that the MetaMask team has a number of unsolved issues and
     its inner workflow structure is neither transparent nor
     decentralized. The post reads:

     “One cannot follow development via the public issue-tracker,
      simply because the team uses an internal tracker and internal
      ‘meetings.’ This is not transparent. This is not decentralized.
      MetaMask is a critical value-moving piece of Ethereum. It is written
      in JavaScript, nearly completely untyped. The code is of low quality,
      full of technical debt (both, in terms of code and architecture).”

- browser extension enabling browsing Ethereum blockchain enabled websites.
- Injects a web3 provider into the window object of the web page.
- It handles account management, ethereum client-node managements,
- Allows users to manage accounts and their keys in a variety of ways,
  including hardware wallets, while isolating them from the site context.
  (vs storing the user keys on a single central server, or even in local storage)

ºCalling a Contract from Web Browser with Metamask and ethjsº
@[https://medium.com/metamask/calling-a-smart-contract-with-a-button-d278b1e76705]
(ethjs is a lightweight alternative to web3.js)
- ethjs (or web3.js) makes use of a web3 provider object.
  This object can be a software object, and injected object (Metamask),
  ....

PRE-SETUP:
$ npm install ethjs

BASIC JS:
// "Webpack dependencies"
const Eth = require('ethjs-query')
const EthContract = require('ethjs-contract')
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0xdeadbeef123456789000000000000'
const CONTRACT_ABI = [{
    "name": "transfer",
    "inputs": [ ...  ],
    "outputs": [ ... ],
    ...
  }]


function initContract (contract) {
  const MiniToken = contract(CONTRACT_ABI)
  const miniToken = MiniToken.at(address)
}

function startApp(web3) {
  const eth = new Eth(ºweb3.currentProviderº)
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     Injected into web page by MetaMask
  const contract = new EthContract(eth)
  initContract(contract)
}

window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  if (typeof web3 === 'undefined') { return; }
  startApp(web3);
})



function onGUIButtonCliced (miniToken) {
    miniToken.transfer(
      toAddress, value, { from: addr })
      .then(
        txHash =˃ {
          console.log('Transaction sent')
          console.dir(txHash)
          waitForTxToBeMined(txHash)
        })
      .catch(e =˃ { ... })

<span title>ver 8 (major upgrade)</span>
@[https://medium.com/metamask/announcing-metamask-version-8-9126dc2df98]

- Unparalleled Privacy Control
  select one or more accounts to associate with
  a website or Bºcreate a new account just for that siteº.
- new connection indicator,
- EIP-2255 (site) permissions system.
  - enhanced permissions will enable powerful features like
    decryption, access to wallet information (like your favorite
    tokens or contacts), and paves the way for MetaMask Snaps
    extensibility.
- Slick, New UI
- More Features For Developers:
  - Web3 Encryption: two new methods to allow websites to
    encrypt and decrypt messages intended for Web3 users.
    - For now, these decryption requests each require user
      confirmation, so it’s mostly ideal for decrypting infrequent,
      important messages, like emails.
  - New onboarding library enabling Dapps to implement their
    own connect button.
    (allow user to seamlessly land on your site, install MetaMask,
     and be automatically redirected back to your application)

  - ERC-1193 Provider API:
    for consistency across clients and applications.
    Instead of (old) ethereum.sendAsync(options, callback)
    pattern everywhere, you now get a nice and simple
    const result = await ethereum.request({ method, params }).
    If you’re a developer that relies on the window.web3 object
    injected by MetaMask, you’ll need to implement changes before we
    remove the injected web3 object or your site will break.
    If you’re a developer that only relies on your own version of
    ethers or web3, you won’t need to take any action — just keep it
    up to date. BºIf you are choosing a new convenience library, we º
  Bºrecommend ethers.º

  - Cutting Edge Security
  BºThe (new) LavaMoat tool helps raise the bar of security forº
  Bºnearly any JavaScript project.º
    LavaMoat uses Secure EcmaScript to confine every third-party
    dependency in a piece of JavaScript code at build time.
    We hope to eventually confine every dependency in our entire
    wallet, greatly protecting us and our users from the category
    of “supply chain attacks”.

  - 1st with Native EIP-712 Support for Use with
    Uniswap V3, Polygon, and More!

 ... When Uniswap V3 launched, liquidity providers were unable to
  migrate their positions because Uniswap uses a new message type
  (EIP712) which is not yet supported on legacy hardware wallets using
  MetaMask and their assets were stuck. Not an issue for Lattice1
  owners... Competitors have publicly shared that even when they do
  support the feature, they will not be using their device's secure
  enclave and will instead create hashes in your computer's web
  browser. Never use your hardware wallet to blindly sign unknown
  hashes.

<span xsmall>meta-transactions</span>
@[https://defirate.com/meta-transactions/]
In essence, meta transactions allow users to interact with a public
blockchain without paying a transaction fee. This leads to a more
seamless UX as users no longer have to understand the inner workings
of public blockchains and market dynamics for transaction fees.

At its core, meta transactions are nearly identical to regular
network transactions but with the addition of a proxy contract, also
known as a relayer. With meta transactions, users still use their
signature to send and authenticate transactions. The difference is,
once this happens, the transaction is now managed by the relayer who
pays the gas and sends the transaction to the receiving address.

By leveraging meta transactions, developers can significantly
streamline the user experience for their applications. Ultimately,
this feature brings the ecosystem closer to a frictionless user
experience when accessing web 3.0 and DeFi.

https://blog.infura.io/ethereum-javascript-libraries-web3-js-vs-ethers-js-part-i/?utm_medium=www.oficina24x7.com
Ethereum JavaScript Libraries: web3.js vs. ethers.js (Part I)
- Both libraries work!!

- Web3.js:
  - 2015
  - Ethereum Foundation Community.
  - It has a good API reference.
  - GLP v3
  - it includes functions to communicate with nodes
    via the JSON-RPC.
  - current (2020-06) version: 1.2.9
  - composed of 6 modules:
    -  web3: main class. "Core functionality"
    - web3-eth:
      - API to interact with smart contracts, externally-owned
        accounts, nodes, mined blocks, and TXs. Ex:
        - web3.eth.getBalance
        - web3.eth.signTransaction
        - web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction
        - ...
    - web3-shh:
      Whisper protocol to broadcast messages easily and for
      low-level asynchronous communication. Ex:
      - web3.shh.post      ← posts whisper msg to Net.
      - web3.shh.subscribe ← creates subscription
      - ...
    - web3-bzz
      Swarm decentralized storage API :
      (files, images, ...). Ex:
      - web3.bzz.upload   ←   Upload files|folders to Swarm
      - Web3.bzz.download ← Download files|folders from "
    - web3-net
      - Interact. API for Network properties of a node.
        - web3.???.net.getID        ← return network ID
        - web3.???.net.getPeerCount ← returns peer number
               ^^^
            protocol of interest: eth|shh|bzz
    - web3-utils. Ex:
      - web3.utils.toWei
      - web3.utils.hexToNumberString
      - web3.utils.isAddress  ← check if string is a valid address.

- Ethers.js:
  - 2018
  - JS + TypeScript
  - small, compact library.
  - "Simple" and "intuitive".
  - large number of test cases.
  - Good "Getting Started" documentation.



- current (2020-06) ver.:  5.0.3.
- MIT License.
- Modules:
  - Ethers.provider
    - abstract connection to node/network.
    - sending signed TXs ("writes") and read-queries.
      - ethers.providers.InfuraProvider:  Infura "client"
      - ethers.provider.getBalance
      - ethers.provider.resolve ← resolve ENS to address

  - Ethers.contract
    - deploy S.C.
    - listen for events emitted
    - call functions
    - get S.C. information
    - Ex:
      - ethers.ContractFactory.fromSolidity:
        Creates "factory" for deployment of S.C. using
        as input:
        - Solc output or
        - Truffle generated JSON file
      - ethers.Contract : ← interact with deployed S.C.
  - Ethers.utils
    - formatting data , process user inputs.
    - Ex:
      - ethers.utils.getContractAddress: Address from deployment TX
      - ethers.utils.computeAddress    : pub/priv: key to address
      - ethers.utils.formatEther       : Wei s to decimal string
  - Ethers.wallets
    - connect to existing wallet, create new one, sign TXs.
    - Ex:
      - ethers.wallet.createRandom
      - ethers.wallet.sign
      -  ethers.wallet.getBalance
    - Equivalent to web3.eth.accounts, but in web3js doc it
      warns: "This package has NOT been audited and might
      potentially be unsafe. Take precautions to clear memory
      properly, store the private keys safely, and test TX
      receiving/sending properly before using in production!"

Comparative:
            starts|Used by|Maintainers|Test   |Size |Unpacked
                  |(repos)|           |support|     |

- ethers.js:~1,500|18.500 |1(Richard  |"WINS" |284kb| 3.5MB
                             Moore)
- ethers.js has surpassed web3.js in weekly downloads
  (even if its younger)
Documentation:
  Web3.js: extensive API ref, Short "Getting Started"
Ethers.js: extensive API ref, Good “Getting Started”  ← Winner

NOTE: bytecode vs deployedBytecode
      solc generates two bytecode blobs per contract that truffle relies on:
      - bytecode includes the wrapper code necessary to init and deploy the contract
      - deployedBytecode just contains the core, deployed code.

@[https://medium.com/@adrianmcli/migrating-your-truffle-project-to-web3-v1-0-ed3a56f11a4]

The most popular library for calling into Ethereum smart contracts from the
Javascript world is Web3.js (repo). In fact, Truffle (the popular Ethereum
dapp framework) injects this within their own test environment.

Unfortunately, the framework itself (and its official examples) use the 0.20.
x version of Web3.js. And while v1.0 is still technically in beta, more and
more people are using it because it provides an API that is more explicit and
is easier to work with (like PromiEvents, I’ll talk about this below)

@[https://docs.web3j.io/filters.html]
- Provide notifications of Ethereum-events
- Based on RXJava
- NOTE: Standard Ethereum filter-classes:
        - Block filters
          - provide only block-hash.
            a second request(block-hash) needed to fetch the actual block
        - Pending TX filters
          - provide only TX-hash.
            a second request(TX-hash) needed to fetch the actual TX
        -ºTopic filtersº (aka SmartContract event-logs):
          - WebSockets
          - JSON-RPC poll

- web3j's managed Filter implementation:
  - Provides a fully asynchronous event based API
    for working with filters.
  - Based on RxJava's Flowables which provides a consistent API
    for working with events, which facilitates the chaining
    together of JSON-RPC calls via functional composition.

<span xsmall>TOPIC FILTERS</span>
 EVM (Smart-Contract) events stored in the TX log of the blockchain.
 - Since code changing the blockchain status (write TXs) are executed
   "at will" (maybe one second later, maybe one hour later) EVM code
   notifies of any return value from calls to smart-contracts functions
   using those events.
   - Note that a solidity function can return a value, but this value
     is just useful to other calling function executed during the TX,
     not to the external web3 client that send the original signed TX
     maybe long time ago. This client only have to oportunity to know
     the TX status by listening for EVM topic log event (filters in web3j)

  STEP 1:
    EthFilter filter = new EthFilter(ºblock0º,ºblock1º, ˂optional-contract-address˃)
                       [º.addSingleTopicº(...) |º.addOptionalTopicsº(..., ...) | ...];
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     - specify topics of interest and initial/end block.
                     - individual topics represent indexed parameters on the smart contract
                     -ºIf no topics are added, all EVM events taking place in the networkº
                      ºwill be captured.º
  STEP 2:
      Subscription subscription =
        web3jº.ethLogFlowable(filter)º.subscribe(log -˃ { ... });

Java Implementation Note:
- blockFlowable itself is composed of two of separate JSON-RPC calls:

public Flowable<EthBlock> blockFlowable(
      boolean fullTransactionObjects, long pollingInterval) {
  // STEP 1: Create flow of block-hash events
  return this.ethBlockHashFlowable(pollingInterval)
    .flatMap(blockHash -˃
      // STEP 2: Map each returned blockHash by using JSON-RPC to query for new block
      web3j.ethGetBlockByHash(blockHash, fullTransactionObjects).flowable()
    );
}

- An interactive text-based platform with which “hobbyists” —
  people who are not programmers, but who are willing to devote a bit
  of time to learning — can interact with ethereum (and other
  compatible blockchains), and do so with a great deal of power and

- A publication tool for ethereum smart contact applications, as
  sbt-ethereum repositories strive to be portable, and to both permit
  deployment of new smart contract instances and convenient interaction
  with already deployed smart contracts.
- For those who are (or wish to become!) programmers, a rich
  development environment for ethereum smart contracts
- An integration tool, which facilitates the development of
  high-performance Scala libraries and applications that interact with
  ethereum smart contracts

BºQuick Tutorial:º
  @[https://www.sbt-ethereum.io/tutorials/using-a-smart-contract-i.html]

  PRE-SETUP:
  - Get deployed contract address.
    (Ex: 0x82ea8ab1e836272322f376a5f71d5a34a71688f1)
  - find the ABI describing the contract.
    - alt 1: Get if from author/github/...
    - alt 2: get it from Etherscan verified ABIs.
      └ Go to http://etherscan.io/
        Input the contract address:
        └ To to "Code" tab with a small green checkmark.
          └ Scroll down to "Contract ABI" section.


$ºsbt:...> ethAddressAliasSet fortune 0x82....1º  ← Set an alias for Contract add
$º...                                          º  with "long hexadecimal" address
$º[success] Total time: ...                    º
$ºsbt:...> ethContractAbiImport fortune        º ← Import ABI
                                                   Paste the "long" JSON when
                                                   requested
$º...                                          º
$º[success] Total time: ...                    º

To automate manually copying/pasting ABIs:
- Create a sign-in at Etherscan
  - Log-in, click on "MY ACCOUNT"
    - Click on "API-KEYs"
      - Click "Create Api Key"
        Fill in optional app name and click "Continue"
        (An Oº"Api-Key Token"º will appear, something like
         87ZVGM4Q4RRMGPSY761MMJZRWYU1RUW339)

Withe the Oº"Api-Key Token"º created, import could be done like:
$ºsbt:...> etherscanApiKeySet 87ZVGM4Q4RRMGPS..º ← Set Etherscan ABI key
$º...                                          º
$º[success] Total time: ...                    º
$ºsbt:...> ethContractAbiImport fortune        º ← Import ABI
$º...                                          º  sbt-ether. finds and
$º[success] Total time: ...                    º  downloads from Etherscan it

RºAdding any constructor to the A contract, and keeping same Bº

SOLUTION:
   solc compiler consider the class abstract and does not generate any
   bin due to some of the following reasons:
    - B will need to provide parent A constructor with a parameter

      Bºconstructor(address _a) A(_a) {º// or A(0x00112...)

YAKINDU Statechart Tools Integration

When examining various smart contracts it became somehow obvious that most of
the Oºcontracts are basically a description of “who is allowed to do what,º
Oºunder which circumstances”  which is in fact a very simple description of a º
Oºstate machineº. Calling a method on such is nothing else than an incoming event
on a state. We started to integrate YAKINDU SCT with YAKINDU Solidity IDE. This
basically means that we can access built-in features of Solidity like
implicitly globally available variables, constants and functions while modeling
our statechart. Once the user is satisfied with his model, and have performed
the necessary verifications, we can generate the solidity code, EVM byte code
and ABI with a single button press.

BºNODEKEY AND VALIDATORº
  To be a validator, a node needs to meet the following conditions:
  - Its account (nodekey-derived) address MUST be listed in extraData's validators section
  - validator nodekey is used as priv.key to sign consensus messages

BºEncoding:º
  Before encoding you need to define a toml file with vanity and validators fields
  to define proposer vanity and validator set. Please refer to example.toml for
  the example. The output would be a hex string which can be put into extraData
  field directly.  Command:
$º$ istanbul encode --config ./config.tomlº

BºDecoding:º
  Use --extradata option to give the extraData hex string. The output would show
  the following if presents: vanity, validator set, seal, and committed seal.
  Command:
  $ istanbul decode --extradata ˂EXTRA_DATA_HEX_STRING˃
  to define proposer vanity and validator set. Please refer to example.toml for
  the example. The output would be a hex string which can be put into extraData
  field directly.  Command:
$º$ istanbul encode --config ./config.tomlº

Bºgenesis.jsonº
  - config field is required, and the pbft subfield must present. Ex:

 network → validator    : reward

º*1º Ethereum Foundation Eth2 deposit contract:
     https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/tree/dev/deposit_contract

- if a validator fails to stay online and execute
  their share of computational responsibilities,
  block reward will moderately decrease as to incentivize
  validators to stay online.

 - Byzantine validators trying to compromise the network
   (i.e. validate incorrect data history), will be punished
   with some/all of their 32 staked ETH.

 - In order for the beacon chain to launch its genesis block,
   at least 524,288 ETH must be staked on the network, divided
   among a minimum of 16,384 validators (these numbers were decided
   upon to ensure sufficient security and decentralization).
 - Staking rewards will not be distributed until this threshold
   is reached, which is partially why some altruistic behavior is
   needed among the early participants in phase 0.

 RºWARN:ºbeacon chain will not be particularly useful to the majority
         of Ethereum users inRºPhase 0º;
         - it will be unable to process transactions, execute smart
           contracts, or host dapps.
         BºThis is by designº, ensuring Proof of Stake undergoes
           considerable testing as a live, functioning network before
           dapps and users begin transacting by the millions on a
           daily basis.

  Phase 0:
  - Original Ethereum 1.0 blockchain will continue to run
    in parallel and receive upgrades during Phase 0.

  Phase 1:
  - Implementation of shard chains.
  - Ethereum will be partitioned into 64 separate (shard) chains,
    coordinated by a beacon chain.

  Phase 1.5:
  - merging of the original PoW Ethereum with PoS chain.
    It will be brought into Ethereum 2.0 and exist as one
    of the 64 shard chains alongside the beacon chain
    with no break in continuity or data history.
    - ETH holders will not have to undergo any sort of
      token transfer or swap between Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0.

  Phase 2:
  - currently (2020-05) less defined.
    Enable ether accounts, transactions, transfers and withdrawals,
    and smart contract execution.

<span xsmall>Cosmos and Tendermint</span>

Cosmos is also building an ecosystem that relies on the Tendermint consensus
mechanism that relies heavily upon Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms. The
platform depends on validators that have similar roles as miners in the
bitcoin network. The validators have staking tokens called Atoms which are
used to secure the network via a proof of stake mechanism that relies upon
the trust generated by the bonded validators. The interplay between the
players in the ecosystem is also indicative of a game theoretical structure
where validators can lose their tokens or the tokens delegated to them if
discovered to be violating the protocol. Due to this bonded deposit design of
stakeholders within this system, the consensus mechanism allows for an
incentivization mechanism that secures the network. This security design
allows for the proper functioning of the Application Blockchain Interface
(ABCI), the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) as well as the
varying interactions between the Cosmos hub and zones.

Authors: Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin
- framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts which
is scalable to a significant amount of state updates per second (potentially
billions) enabling the blockchain to be able to represent a significant
amount of decentralized financial applications worldwide. These smart
contracts are incentivized to continue operation autonomously via network
transaction fees, which is ultimately reliant upon the underlying blockchain
(e.g. Ethereum) to enforce transactional state transitions.
_____________________________

https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf
The orchestrated transaction processing paradigm using the interplay between
rootchains, plasma chains, and child chains through a combination of fraud-
proof mechanism designs and fidelity bond incentive structures help satisfy
dynamics between the block-withholding and mass withdrawal surfaces. It also
allows for further cryptoeconomic structures to be filled using mechanisms
from systems like Casper or Truebit for mirroring concepts used in erasure
coding in terms of the data availability problem that is prevalent in the
space. For a multichain architecture, Ethereum would be able to combine the
database coordination and throughput capabilities of a distributed database
system with the public chain compatible capabilities of an actual blockchain.
_____________________________

https://media.consensys.net/blockchain-vs-distributed-ledger-technologies-1e0289a87b16
Through technical evaluations of tools like Plasma and formats of obtaining
consensus in Casper, it is apparent that database management tools like
MapReduce and Abstract Rewrite Systems will be implemented in Ethereum. In
Plasma, MapReduce is an integral part of assembling the coordination of an
account based system and a bitmap-UTXO commitment structure of a multichain
setup.
  ...
Plasma shares quite a bit of influence from a heavily cryptoeconomic
incentive structure focused platform called Truebit which was designed to
increase the offchain computational capabilities of the Ethereum network. By
architecting the Truebit system around a verification game in which Solvers
of the overall consensus mechanism can be challenged by Verifiers which
obtain a reward if they identify a nefarious counterparty, an internal
cryptoeconomic ?checks and balances? of the system is created to incentive a
dominant strategy of behaving fairly. As Plasma through the influence of
TrueBit is focused on creating a multichain interoperability network, the
internal enforcement of the system is paramount toward achieving information
and consensus fidelity.

_ Alethio's analytics platform helps users visualize,
  interpret, and react to blockchain data in real time.


""" Current blockchain explorers provide little clarity into the evolving ecosystem.
ºThey are often geared towards developers and leave average users in the dark.º

 How do we access real time block data,ºanalyzing the application layer,º
 detecting anomalies, or monitoring the statistical signals that translate to larger KPIs.
"""

ºUNSUPERVISED LEARNINGº
- find patterns in large data sets.
- reduce complex dataset to simpler high-level patterns/themes.
- By reducing a large dataset into a small number of common themes,
  one can learn what it means for a particular transaction or account
  point to be "normal". (ºanomaly detectionº), or compared to a recent
  historical average (ºnovelty detectionº).
- As of 2019-03 Alethio offers an anomaly detection system for
  TXs, blocks, and accounts.
  - ranking algorithms
  - influence analysis like page rank.

ºSUPERVISED LEARNINGº
- there must be some large initial set of data for which the value
  of the labels or responses is known.
  -ºRakr:º
    - gather external data about accounts (metadata) for the
      purposes of machine learning.
    - Rakr hopes to provide a platform for gathering and sharing
      this valuable metadata.
  - two common subcategories:
    -ºprediction:º
      - use historical data to estimate future value
      - account type:
        - decentralized exchange
        - DOS
        - Ponzi scheme
      - Price prediction (training input: "large set" of historical prices).
    -ºclassification:º
      - use historical data and some given-entity data
        to classify the given-entity. (labeling)

  -  raw data ("the set of knowns") can be used to extract features
     for accounts (total balance, average TX frequency/age/...)

  - Alethio recently added semantic lifting to expand the set of "knowns"
    beyond the protocol layer to include application-level data, such as
    whether a contract is a token, and to which standard it complies.

ºIn Practiceº
Ex: Ponzi model developed by Alethio:
- First model, to expand to more general fraud models in near term.
- feature extraction pipelines built during this model development effort
  can be reused to classify any account according to one of the labels
  in the (growing) Rakr database. (exchange, art DAO, ICOs, casino, fraud, DoS-alike, ...)
- ... we envision a blockchain where every account and entity is enriched with
  useful classifications and properties, whether empirical and created by humans,
  or predicted and created by statistical models.

Keep an eye out for the next article by Paul Lintilhac, which will give an exposition of one of
Alethio’s recent data science initiatives: the Ponzi Model.

ºADVANCED CONFIGº

ºKafka Broadcasting Correlation Id Strategiesº
Each subscribed event can have a correlation id strategy association with it,
during subscription.
- A correlation id strategy defines what the kafka message key for a
  broadcast event should be, and allows the system to be configured so that
  events with particular parameter values are always sent to the same
  partition.

- Currently supported correlation id strategies are:
  - Indexed Parameter Strategy: An indexed parameter within the event
    is used as the message key when broadcasting.
  - Non Indexed Parameter Strategy: An non-indexed parameter within the
    event is used as the message key when broadcasting.

ºEVENT STOREº
- Eventeum utilises an event store in order to establish
  the block number to start event subscriptions from,
  in the event of a failover.

- For example, if the last event broadcast for event with id X
  had a block number of 123, then on a failover, eventeum will
  subscribe to events from block 124.

2 supported event store implementations:
  - MongoDB:
    Env Variable             Default    Description
    EVENTSTORE_TYPE          DB         MongoDB event store enabled
    SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST localhost  The mongoDB host
    SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PORT 27017      The mongoDB post

  - REST Service:
    (see original link for more info)

ºEMBEDDING EVENTEUMº
Eventeum can be embedded into an existing Spring Application
via an annotation following next steps.

STEP 1:  Add Kauri repo to the pom.xml:
  ˂repositories˃
    ˂repository˃
      ˂id˃bintray-consensys-kauri˂/id˃
      ˂url˃https://consensys.bintray.com/kauri˂/url˃
    ˂/repository˃
  ˂/repositories˃

STEP 2: Add eventeum-core dependency to pom.xml:
  ˂dependency˃
    ˂groupId˃net.consensys.eventeum˂/groupId˃
    ˂artifactId˃eventeum-core˂/artifactId˃
    ˂version˃ºLATEST_EVENTEUM_VERSIONº˂/version˃
  ˂/dependency˃

STEP 3: Within your Application class or a
  @Configuration annotated class, add the
  @EnableEventeum annotation.

Known Caveats / Issues
- In multi-instance mode, where there is more than
one Eventeum instance in a system, your services are
required to handle duplicate messages gracefully, as each
instance will broadcast the same events.

<span xsmall TODO>EXTERNAL STORAGE (IPFS,...)</span>
TODO: Compare with alternative Storage "providers": IPFS , Maidsafe, Storj
- IPFS is just a protocol like http. It is unmotivated (don't have tokens).
- Eris is permissioned blockchain thing and use IPFS underneath.
- Storj, SAFE Network, Sia and Filecoin: motivated storage networks with
  different underlying protocols and design decisions.
- Swarm is an organizational idea. A philosophical structure.
  ""serverless hosting incentivised peer-to-peer storage and content distribution""
  ""From the end user's perspective, Swarm is not that different from WWW,
    except that uploads are not to a specific server. The objective is to peer-to-peer
    storage and serving solution that is DDOS-resistant, zero-downtime, fault-tolerant
    and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive
    system which uses peer to peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.
    Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer
    of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution,
    service payments and content availability insurance. """"""

""""""Two major features of swarm that sets it apart from other decentralised
distributed storage solutions (bittorent, zeronet, IPFS) are 'upload and
disappear' and the incentive system. The former refers to fact that Swarm
does not only serve content, but it also provides a cloud storage service.
Unlike related systems, you do not only publish the fact you host content,
but there is a genuine sense in which you can just upload stuff to the swarm
and potentially disappear (drop off as a node, disconnect or just operate
without storage entirely) right away. Swarm aspires to be the generic storage
and delivery service catering for all usecases ranging from serving low
latency realtime interactive web applications as well as acting as guaranteed
persistent storage for rarely used content. The incentive system makes sure
that participating nodes following their rational self interest nontheless
converge on an emergent swarm behaviour that is beneficial for the entire
system as well as economically self-sustaining. In particular, it allows
nodes in the network to pool their bandwidth and storage resources in the
most efficient way to collectively provide services. """""""
here are two kinds of accounts in Ethereum which share the same address space
: External accounts that are controlled by public-private key pairs (i.e.
humans) and contract accounts which are controlled by the code stored
together with the account.

<span xsmall>External Inputs (Oracles)</span>
The evm and SmartContract by extensions just have access to internal (current-state)
blockchain data.
Oracles are used when we need logic that depends of external-to-blockchain events.

Oracles in practices are "trusted" smart-contracts whose internal data/status
is the result of a list of (N-of-M different) Signatures.
For example we trust a deployed Oracle that clains that a vehicle with ID:ABCDEF had
an accident because map( hashOfCAR_ID =˃ carStatus) ddbbStatus is updated
only after at least N signatures of M trusted signers have been sent claiming
such accident is true.

 <span xsmall>Whisper Dapp Protocol</span>
@[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper]
- communication protocol to communicate DApps with each other for off-chain Data.

ºUSE CASE:º
    DApps that need to publish small amounts of information to each other and
have the publication last some substantial amount of time. For example, a
currency exchange DApp may use it to record an offer to sell some currency at
a particular rate on an exchange. In this case, it may last anything between
tens of minutes and days. The offer wouldn't be binding, merely a hint to get
a potential deal started.

    DApps that need to signal to each other in order to ultimately
collaborate on a transaction. For example, a currency exchange DApp may use
it to coordinate an offer prior to creating one (or two, depending on how the
exchange is structured) transactions on the exchange.

    DApps that need to provide non-real-time hinting or general
communications between each other. E.g. a small chat-room app.

    DApps that need to provide dark (plausible denial over perfect network
traffic analysis) comms to two correspondents that know nothing of each other
but a hash. This could be a DApp for a whistleblower to communicate to a
known journalist exchange some small amount of verifiable material and
arrange between themselves for some other protocol (Swarm, perhaps) to handle
the bulk transfer.

<span title>GraphQL over HTTP</span>
@[https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Interact/APIs/GraphQL/]

  - Reduce overhead for common queries.
    Ex:
    Non-GraphQL                 GraphQL:
    ----------------------      ------------------
    - query Rºeach receiptº     - single query for
      in a block


- The Besu GraphQL schema describes the GraphQL implementation for
  Ethereum. Enable the GraphQL service using command line options.

Note

GraphQL is not supported over WebSockets.

Access the GraphQL endpoint at http://<HOST>:<PORT>/graphql.
Configure <HOST> and <PORT> using graphql-http-host and
graphql-http-port. The default endpoint is
http://127.0.0.1:8547/graphql.
GraphQL requests with cURL

Hyperledger Besu JSON-RPC API methods with an equivalent GraphQL
query include a GraphQL request and result in the method example.

Example

The following syncing request returns data about the synchronization
status.

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{ "query": "{syncing{startingBlock currentBlock highestBlock}}"}'
 http://localhost:8547/graphql

GraphQL requests with GraphiQL App

The third-party tool, GraphiQL, provides a tabbed interface for
editing and testing GraphQL queries and mutations. GraphiQL also
provides access to the Besu GraphQL schema from within the app.

Besu does not execute pending transactions so results from account,
call, and estimateGas for Pending do not reflect pending transactions.

Example
Pending Transaction Count

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{ "query": "{pending {transactionCount}}"}' \
  http://localhost:8547/graphql

Pending Transactions

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{ "query": "{pending {transactions{hash}}}"}' \
 http://localhost:8547/graphql

BºImplementation of event handlersº
  Refer to The Graph documentation, to learn how to write mappings.

  - basics about mappings:
    - To create a new entity instance, call:
      ˂Entity˃#create(˂id˃)  ← ˂id˃ is a string that must be generated.
    - To be able to retrieve instances from blockchain data,
      the IDs should be composed of addresses, hashes, etc...
    - To load an existing entity, call:
      ˂Entity˃#load(˂id˃)
    - To save new entity|update existing one, call:
      ˂entity˃.save()
    - To destroy and remove an entity from the store, call
      store.remove('EntityName', id)

BºRunning the subgraphº

  $ yarn run build        ←·· Build SubGraph
  $ yarn run create-local ←·· Declare it  on local Graph node
  $ yarn run deploy-local ←·· Deploy  to the local Graph node
  $ yarn run watch-local  ←·· Optional: Watch deployig after
                                      each code update


  GraphQL UI for queries available at:
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/domain/graph-name/graphql
                                       └──────┬────────┘

                                       of the subgraph

Note: Whenever the Ethereum network has been reseted
      (Ganache restarted,...), the ./docker/data must
      be deleted:
      - required to clean the existing database
        that checks the genesis block for the
        current ethereum network.

<a href="http://leveldb.org/">LevelDB</a> (key/value) storage backend.
  - entries stored lexicographically sorted by keys.
    (sorting comes-in very useful for querying)
  - Arbitrary byte arrays:
    keys and values are treated as simple arrays of bytes,
    so content can be anything from ASCII strings to binary blobs.
  - Compressed storage:
    Google’s Snappy compression library (optional) dependency,
    highly optimized for fast compression (vs high compress ratio)
  - Ex ussage:
    var level = require('level')
    var db = level('./db', { valueEncoding: 'json' })

    db.put('key', { example: true }, function (err) {
      if (err) throw err

      db.get('key', function (err, value) {

OSX packages      : @[https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum]


- Performance Improvements in block processing:
  - The discovery and optimization of a quadratic CPU and disk IO complexity,
     originating from the Go implementation of LevelDB.
  - optimization of various EVM opcodes
  - ...

- Allow separated database into two parts:
  - Recent blocks, all state and accelerations structures   ← Ideal to ºput on SSDº since both disk IO performance is crucial.
    are stored in fast key-value store (LevelDB)
  - Blocks and receipts that are older than a cutoff        ← infrequent access,ºHDD should be more than suitableº
    threshold (3 epochs) are moved out of LevelDB into a      Use --datadir.ancient to move outside chaindata ("SSD" disk)
    custom freezer database, that is backed by a handful
    of append-only flat files.

  - Ex: A fresh fast sync at block 7.77M placed
    - 60GB of data into LevelDB
    - 79GB of data into the freezer

  -  NOTE: What happens if one of the two databases goes missing?
     - If the freezer database is deleted the node would become unusable.
     - If the state   database is deleted, Geth will reconstruct all its
       indices based on the frozen data and then do a fast sync on top
       to back-fill the missing state. Next command will actually delete
       it and reconstruct from freezer:
       $ geth removedb --datadir ... --datadir.ancient ...
       (will take 1+ hours in mainnet)

- GraphQL (--graphql CLI flag):
- Ported from work by [Raúl Kripalani, Kris Shinn, Nick Johnson, Infura, Pegasys]
  pioneering both the GraphQL spec and its implementation
- Support for flexible queries (INNER JOINS) in a single round trip, saving lot of bandwidth.
- Ex: find all the ENS domain registrations on the Görli testnet!
  STEP 1: Start Geth v1.9.0 on Görli with GraphQL enabled
  $ geth --goerli --graphql  ← should sync in 1-2 minutes tops

  STEP 2: point browser to the built in GraphQL explorer:
  $ http://localhost:8547
   ºintegrated code completionº
   ºfield documentation       º
   ºlive query execution      º

  STEP 3: sample query to find the ENS HashRegistered events and
          returns the address of the user doing the registration
          along with the block number and timestamp it was included in:

GraphQL:
{
  logs(                                ← "SELECT FROM  logs INNER JOIN address ON ... "
    filter: {                          ←   "WHERE"
      fromBlock: 0,                    ←     "BLOCK ˃ 0 AND"
      addresses: ["0xf105....62"],     ←     "ADDRESSES IN (${ENS_CONTRACT}) AND "
      topics   : [["0x0f0...670"]]     ←     "TOPICS    IN (HashRegistered) "
    }                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  )
  {
    transaction {                      ← RETURN:
      hash
      from {
        address                        ← + address of the user doing the registration
      }
      block{
        number                         ← + block number
        timestamp                      ← + timestamp
      }
    }
  }
}

ºSUPPORTED HARDWARE WALLETSº
 - LEDGER WALLETS
   - Ledger Nano S
   - Ledger Nano X (via USB)
   - v1.9.0 will now use  canonical HD derivation path
     used by all Ethereum wallets (and presently by Ledger too).
   Ledger SETUP:
   - (Linux only) explicitly allow user to access wallet via udev rule
   - Plug Ledger Nano S/X
   - Unlock via your PIN code.
   - Start the Ethereum app on your Ledger
     (Geth will log Ethereum app offline).
     - You can list all your accounts like:
       - Alternative 1: Geth console like:
         ~ personal.listWallets
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           This will auto-derive any accounts that
           you've used before + 1 empty new one.
       - Alternative 2: RPC 'personal_listWallets'

 - TREZOR WALLETS
   - Trezor One: Geth v1.9.0 implements the new WebUSB protocol
                 supporting updated Trezor One models, and old
                 USB HID protocol for non-updated devices.
     Trezor One SETUP:
     - (Linux only) explicitly allow user to access wallet via udev rule
     - Plug Trezor One
     - Geth will detect it but will prompt you to open it.
     - Call personal.openWallet('trezor://...')
       with the URL of the device.
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                check it via personal.listWallets
     - console will keep prompting for PIN entry and password as needed.
     - Calling via RPC, openWallet returns a detailed error if it needs another call.
     - list accounts in a similar way to Ledger wallets.
     Geth will forward the signing request to the Trezor.
   - Trezor Model T:
     Trezor Model T SETUP: (workflow is simpler as PIN entry is done on device)
     - (Linux only) explicitly allow user to access wallet via udev rule
     - Plug Trezor Model T
     - unlock via PIN code (Geth should detect it)
     - list accounts in a similar way to Ledger wallets.

 - STATUS KEYCARDS
   - full HD hardware wallet ºbased on Java SmartCardsº
   - Status keycard can be used via Geth only through
     the PC/SC daemon for now (you need to install it)
     and via USB (the +iD is a good USB smartcard reader).

   PRE-SETUP:
     - initialize Status keycard
   SETUP:
     - Plug in your Status keycard via a USB card reader.
     - Check the status of your card via personal_listWallets.
     - Permit Geth to use the card via personal.openWallet('keycard://...').
       - The very first time Geth will ask you to pair your card via the passphrase.
       - In normal operation, Geth will ask you to unlock your card via your PIN code.
       - On too many wrong PINs, Geth will ask you to reset your card via your PUK code.
       - On too many wrong PUKs, your card will be bricked and you’ll need to reinstall it.
       - Alternatively you can do the same thing through RPC via multiple personal_openWallet().

ºCLEF (wallets everywhere!)º
- accounts and networking don't go well together security wise,
- Geth v1.9.0 ships a standalone signer for the entire Ethereum ecosystem
  called Clef.
- major features:
  - remove account management from Geth allowing Geth to
    be an "insecure" network gateway into Ethereum, fixing
    the issues when accidentally exposing accounts via RPC
    (old method is still available for compatibility)
  - Usable by arbitrary programs (Geth, Parity, Trinity, Metamask, MyCrypto, decentralized apps,...)
    - Clef exposes a deliberately tiny external API via IPC (default) or HTTP,
      to allow signing  requests to Clef. Clef in turn will prompt
      the user for manual confirmation.
  - Pluggable interface
    - designed to work with any interface: cli, web, Android, ..
    - Clef exposes an extended internal API solely via standard input/output.
      and JSON-RPC IO streams.
    - pre-built CLI interface
  - Embedded 4byte database!
    The 4byte database enable by looking at the first 4 bytes of the
    giant TX blob, to guess what the rest of the data is meant to represent,
    and can thus show the user a meaningful dump of what they are about
    to confirm (images above and below courtesy of Etherscan) like:
    0xd459fc46.... mapped to:
    #      Name             Type      Data
    0     _recentNumber     uint256   4638288
    1     _recentHash       bytes32   dbb5e8.....
    2     _hash             bytes32   488c....
    3     _sectionIndex     uint64    140
    4     v                 unit8[]   28
                                      28
    5     r                 bytes32[] b85...
                                      dc7...
    6     s                 bytes32[] 38fb6..
                                      5d858...
   ºClef send the decoded call back to the UI, and add warningº
   ºmessages if the data does not match the method signature! º

  - Programmatic rules for automated (batch) transactions.
    (e.g. Clique signer, Raiden relay, Swarm exchange, etc).
    Clef solves this via an encrypted key-value store and an ingenious
    rule engine! Instead of prompting the user to confirm each and every
    request via a passphrase entry, we can permit Clef to sign on our
    behalf by storing our passphrase in its encrypted database.
    This will only allow passwordless signing, but still needs
    manual confirmation!
    - As a second step, however, we can also provide Clef with a
      JavaScript rule file, that will run whenever a request arrives
      and can decide to auto-confirm, auto-reject, or forward the request
      for manual confirmation.
    - The JavaScript rules have access to the entire request and can
      also store arbitrary data in a key-value store for persistence.
      Ex:
      function ApproveSignData(req) {
        if (req.address.toLowerCase() == "0xd9....") {
            if (req.messages[0].value.indexOf("bazonk") ˃= 0) {
                return "Approve"
            }
            return "Reject"
        }
        // ... Otherwise continue with manual processing
        ...
      }

ºLIGHT CLIENTSº
- Geth v1.9.0 ships a new ultra light client.
  This mode aims to position itself midway on the security spectrum
  between a trusted server and a light server, replacing PoW verification
  with digital signatures from a majority of trusted servers.
- With enough signatures from independent entities, you could achieve
  more than enough security for non-critical DApps. That said,
 ºultra light client mode is not really meant for your average node,       º
 ºrather for projects wishing to ship Geth embedded into their own process.º

ºCHECKPOINT ORACLEº
 - Light clients, instead of downloading and verifying each header from
   the genesis to chain head, use a hard coded checkpoint (shipped within Geth)
   as a starting point. Of course, this checkpoint contains all the necessary
   infos to cryptographically verify even past headers, so security wise
   nothing is lost.
   Some shortcomings:
   - hard coded into release binaries: older releases will always start
     syncing from an older block.
   - Can NOT be used in private networks.
 - Geth v1.9.0 ships support for an on-chain checkpoint oracle. Instead of
   relying on hard-coded checkpoints, light clients can reach out to untrusted
   remote light servers (peer-to-peer, no centralized bs) and ask them to
   return an updated checkpoint stored within an on-chain smart contract,
   and cryptographically prove that the returned data was signed by a required
   number of approved signers!
   - How does a light client know who's authorized to sign an on-chain checkpoint?
     - For networks supported out of the box, Geth ships with hard coded checkpoint
       oracle addresses and lists of authorized signers (so you're trusting the same
       devs who ship Geth itself).
     - For private networks, the oracle details can be specified via a config file.
   - checkpoint oracle contract is an especially nasty beast:
     a) it goes out of its way to retain security even in the face of chain reorgs
     b) it needs to support sharing and proving checkpoints to not-yet-synced clients.
     Geth v1.9.0 ships a "checkpoint-admin" tool specifically for this contract.
     (useful to run your checkpoint oracle in a  private network).
     $ checkpoint-admin \                      ← query status of deployed contract
         --rpc ~/.ethereum/rinkeby/geth.ipc \
         status
     Oracle =˃ 0xebe8eFA441B9302A0d7eaECc277c09d20D684540

     Admin 1 =˃ 0xD9C9Cd5f6779558b6e0eD4e6Acf6b1947E7fA1F3
     Admin 2 =˃ 0x78d1aD571A1A09D60D9BBf25894b44e4C8859595
     ...
     (can also be used to deploy or sign updated checkpoint)

ºMONITORINGº
- Metrics collection gathering     exposed metrics:

ºDISCOVERY PROTOCOLº
- ºEthereum Node Records (ENR) extensionº Support
  new discovery protocol, which can actually run on top of the old protocol too!
  An ENR is a tiny, 300 byte, arbitrary key-value data set, that nodes can advertise
  and query via discovery. Fixes scenarios in private networks (few nodes),
  network forks, updates, ...
  Nodes can now advertise a lot of metadata about themselves without an expensive
  TCP + crypto handshake, thus allowing potential peers to filter out unwanted
  connections without ever making them in the first place!

ºBOOTNODESº
-BºTo go along our Geth v1.9.0 release, we've decided to launch a new set of bootnodesº
 Bºthat is managed via Terraform and Ansible; and monitored via Datadog and Papertrailº.
   (legacy bootnodes will be gradually sunset)
   New list of bootnodes is:

ºOTHER CHANGESº

    Source code, git tags and whatnot on our GitHub release page.
    Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our downloads page.
    Docker images published under ethereum/client-go.
    Ubuntu packages in our Launchpad PPA repository.
    OSX packages in our Homebrew Tap repository.

And as a last word before signing off (better twice than none):

Warning: We’ve tried our best to squash all the bugs, but as with all major
  releases, we advise everyone to take extra care when upgrading. The v1.9.0
  release contains database schema changes, meaning it’s not possible to
  downgrade once updated. We also recommend a fresh fast sync as it can
  drastically reduce the database size.

[P]SMRT-030:Enterprise Ethereum clients MUST support
   smart contracts of at least 24,576bytes in size
[P]SMRT-040:Enterprise Ethereum clients MUST read and enforce a size limit
   for smartcontracts from the current network configuration (e.g. the genesis
   block).
[P]SMRT-050: If no contract size limit is specified in a genesis block,
   subsequent hard fork blockor network configuration, Enterprise Ethereum
   clients MUST enforce a size limit on smartcontracts of 24,576 bytes.

- Permissioning is the property of a system that ensures operations are
  executed by and accessible todesignated parties. For Enterprise Ethereum,
  permissioning refers to:
  - the ability of a node to join an Enterprise Ethereum blockchain
  - the ability of individual accounts or nodes to perform
    specific functions.
  - Ex: an Enterprise Ethereum blockchain might only allow certain nodes
    to act as validators, and only certain accounts to instantiate smart
    contracts.Enterprise Ethereum provides a permissioned implementation
    of Ethereum supporting peer nodeconnectivity permissioning,
    account permissioning, and transaction type permission.

7.1.1 Nodes:
  [C] NODE-010:Enterprise Ethereum implementations MUST provide the ability
      to specify atstartup a list of static peer nodes to establish
      peer-to-peer connections with.
  [C] NODE-020:Enterprise Ethereum clients MUST provide the ability to enable
      or disable peer-to-peer node discovery.
  [P] NODE-030:Enterprise Ethereum clients MUST provide the ability to specify
      a whitelist of thenodes permitted to connect to a node.
  [P] NODE-040:Enterprise Ethereum clients MAY provide the ability to specify
      a blacklist of thenodes not permitted to connect to a node.7.1 Permissions
      and Credentials Sublayer
  [P] NODE-050: It MUST be possible to specify the node whitelist required by
      NODE-030 througha transaction into a smart contract.
  [P] NODE-060: It MUST be possible to specify the node blacklist allowed by
      NODE-040 (ifimplemented) through a transaction into a smart contract.
  [P] NODE-080:Enterprise Ethereum clients MUST provide the ability to specify
      node identities ina way aligned with the concept of groups.
  [P] NODE-090:Enterprise Ethereum clients MUST document which metadata parameters
      (if any)can affect transaction ordering, and what the effects are.

- Private contracts cannot update public contracts.
  (not all participants will be able to execute a private contract,
  and so if that contract can update a public contract, then each
  participant will end up with a different state for the public contract.
- Once a contract has been made public, it can't later be made private.
  You DO need to delete from the blockchain and create a new private contract

<span xsmall>TX Manager</span>
  - Quorum’s Transaction Manager is responsible for Transaction privacy.
     It stores and allows access to encrypted transaction data, exchanges encrypted
     payloads with other participant's Transaction Managers but does not have
     access to any sensitive private keys. It utilizes the Enclave for
     cryptographic functionality (although the Enclave can optionally be
     hosted by the Transaction Manager itself.)

  - """To send a private transaction, a PrivateTransactionManager must be
     configured. This is the service which transfers private payloads to
     their intended recipients, performing encryption and related operations
     in the process."""
  - The Transaction Manager is restful/stateless and can be load balanced easily.

<a href='https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/Transaction-Processing'>Transaction Processing</a>
  - 'Public Transactions' and 'Private Transactions' are a notional concept
    only and Quorum does not introduce new Transaction Types, but rather, the
    Ethereum Transaction Model has been extended to include an optional
    'OºprivateForº' parameter (the population of which results in a Transaction
    being treated as private by Quorum) and the Transaction Type has a new
    IsPrivate method to identify such Transactions.
  - OºprivateForº can take multiple addresses in a comma separated list.
  - Private Transactions payload is only visible to the network
    participants specified in the OºprivateForº parameter of the TX.
  - Quorum Node sets the Transaction_Signature.V = 37 or 38
    (as opposed to 27 or 28)

  - prior to propagate the TX to the rest of the network,
    mining/sender node replaces the original TX-Payload with
    a the hash of the encrypted Payload that received from the
    secure enclave implementation (Crux, Constellation,..).
    Participants involved in the OºprivateForº TX
    will have the encrypted payload associated to the hash
    within their secure enclave.

  Example priv.TX A←→B:<span bgorange>
Party A and B belongs to TX AB, whilst C doesn't
Party A → A.Node: TX + payload
                TX.OºprivateForº [ pub.key A, pub.keyB]
A.Node → A TX Manager: Request to store TX payload
A_TX_Manager → Enclave: - Validate sender with A priv.key

Enclave → Enclave:  performs TX conversion (encrypt payload)
                    - generating [sym.key, random Nonce]
                    - encrypting TX.payload+Nonce with sym.key
                    - generate hash  SHA3-512 (encrypted payload)
                    - iterate through TX recipients [A, B] encrypting
                      sym.key with recipient's pub.key (PGP encryption)
A_TX_Manager ← Enclave: encrypted payload, SHA3-512 hash, encrypted keys
A_TX_Manager → A_TX_Manager: store encrypted payload, encrypted sym.key
                             (using hash as index)
A_TX_Manager → B_TX_Manager: (via HTTPS) hash, encrypted (payload, sym.key)
A_TX_Manager ← B_TX_Manager: Ack
A.Node ←  A_TX_Manager: SHA3-512 (encrypted payload)
A.Node →  A.Node: - Replace TX.payload with TX.sha3-512
                  - changes TX.V to 37 or 38 (indicates other nodes that
                    hash represents priv.TX)
A_TX_Manager → Network:  (Ethereum P2P protocol) TX encrypted payload
Network → Network: +block containing TX AB
Network → Node N: block containing TX AB
Node N → Node N: Try validate TX in block
                 - Recognise TX.V is 37 or 38
Node N → Node N TX_Manager: Do nodes holds private TX?
Node N ← Node N TX_Manager: YES  (continue validation)
                         or "NotARecipient" (skip to next TX in block)
A,B Node → A,B enclave: TX payload
           A,B enclave: 1. validates signature
                        2. decrypts sym.key  private key that is held
                           in The Enclave, decrypts the Transaction Payload using
                           the now-revealed symmetric key and returns the decrypted
                           payload to the Transaction Manager.
A,B TX_Manager → A,B EVM: send decrypted payload
A,B EVM → A,B EVM: contract code execution
                   Update Quorum Node's Private StateDB only.

<span xsmall>Secure Enclave</span>
 - Distributed Ledger protocols typically leverage cryptographic techniques
   for transaction authenticity, participant authentication, and historical
   data preservation (i.e. through a chain of cryptographically hashed data
   .) In order to achieve a separation of concerns, as well as to provide
   performance improvements through parallelization of certain crypto-
   operations, much of the cryptographic work including symmetric key
   generation and data encryption/decryption is delegated to the Enclave.
 - The Enclave works hand in hand with the Transaction Manager to
   strengthen privacy by managing the encryption/decryption in an isolated
   way. It holds private keys and is essentially a “virtual HSM” isolated
   from other components.
 - Different implementations of the enclave exists:
   - Constellation: Original, writen in Haskell
   - Crux         : Golang based, compatible with Constellation

  └─ Remove any null byte (0x00) in front of the private part,
     (this happens "sometimes"). Priv.key length must be 32 bytes

     Uncompressed Public key length must be 64 bytes long
     (65 with the ºconstant 0x04 prefixº)

STEP 2: Extract the public key and format properly for keccak-256:
$ cat /tmp/splitedKey01 | grep pub -A 5 | tail -n +2 |
            tr -d '\n[:space:]:' | sed 's/^04//' \
  > /tmp/pubKey01
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 (example script to extract the 64 bytes in a row)

 Output (/tmp/pubKey01) must look similar to:
 836b35a026743e823a90a0ee3b91bf615c6a757e2b60b9e1dc1826fd0dd16106f7bc1e8179f665015f43c6c81f39062fc2086ed849625c06e04697698b21855e
 (hexadecimal representation of the 64 bytes)

STEP 3: Calculate Ethereum address as:

$ cat /tmp/pubKey01 | keccak-256sum -x -l | tr -d ' -' | tail -c 41
                                    ^^      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                            Input are hex   keep only the last 20 bytes
                            char(vs string) (get rid of first 12).
                                            20bytes = 40chars (+1 line return)

  Output will be similar to
  → 0bed7abd61247635c1973eb38474a2516ed1d884
    0         1         2         3
     123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789

RºCAUTION!: if final address looks like
    *0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470* this means you
     have hashed an empty public key. Sending funds to this
     address will lock them forever!

STEP 4: (Optional) Import private key to geth
# Extract the private key and remove the leading zero byte
$ geth account import priv "privateKey_hexFormat_no_leading_00"
Passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:
Address: {0bed7abd61247635c1973eb38474a2516ed1d884}

You're now ready to use the new account with geth. Of course,
it would be easier to take advantage of the geth account new feature
in order to quickly setup an Ethereum account. But manually doing
it gives you the power of knowing your public and unencrypted
private keys. In addition, this would be useful to generate a
secure Ethereum account completely off chain.

└ Privacy of participants:
  Allow for anonymous parties.
  - on-chain cryptographic mechanisms
    like ring signatures, stealth addresses, mixing,
    or storage of private data off-chain.
└ Privacy of data:
  keep transactions, balances, smart contracts,
  and other data encrypted on or off chain, with
  cryptographic tools like zero-knowledge proofs
  and zk-SNARKS, Pedersen commitments, or off-chain
  privacy layers like TEEs.
  └ Consensys Project Ubin:
    - Public TX validated by the whole network but whose
      amount, asset type,... are shielded.
      "...a consortium of financial institutions used
        zero-knowledge proofs to enable the transfer of digital assets on a
        distributed ledger without revealing information about the balances
        or TX amounts"
    - Project Khokha (South African Reserve Bank "PoC")
      Pe commitments are also additively homomorphic, which means that
      for a balance update, network participants can validate that the correct
      update has happened without knowing the opening balance, the closing
      balance, or the transfer amount.
    - Pedersen commitments and Folklore range proofs to process the typical
      daily volume of payments for the SARB with full confidentiality and
      finality in less than two hours. These commitment schemes proved to be
      much quicker to validate than the zero-knowledge proofs.
    - Adhara has been exploring substituting range proofs with bullet proofs,
      which are much smaller and quicker to validate. Very simply, instead
      of writing the balances and the transaction amounts in the clear as in
      a normal ERC20 contract, nodes write a proof or a Pedersen commitment
      of the balance.
└ Public-First + Privacy Layers = Future-Proof
  - Business networks need resilience, interoperability, permissioning,
    and privacy to succeed.

"...These requirements, however, are out of scope for proprietary distributed
ledgers, let alone traditional database technologies. The Ethereum
granular privacy layers and public-first approach make it a powerful
enterprise solution for organizations that need the flexibility of an in-
house platform and that want the global reach to participate in economies of
scale.

@[https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera]
- Enterprise Implementation of Quorum's transaction manager
- stateless Java system that is used to enable the encryption,
  decryption, and distribution of private transactions for Quorum.

Each Tessera node:
  - Generates and maintains a number of private/public key pairs
  - Self manages and discovers all nodes in the network (i.e. their
    public keys) by connecting to as few as one other node
  - Provides Private and Public API interfaces for communication:
    Private API - This is used for communication with Quorum
    Public  API - This is used for communication between Tessera
                  peer nodes
  - Provides two way SSL using TLS certificates and various trust
    models like Trust On First Use (TOFU), whitelist, certificate
    authority, etc.
  - Supports IP whitelist
  - Connects to any SQL DB which supports the JDBC client

  - self-managing, peer-to-peer network of "key server+PGP+MTAs" nodes
  - Constellation is not blockchain-specific, and potentially applicable
     in many other types of applications
  - Constellation's current primary application is to implement the
    "privacy engine" for Quorum Private transactions (TX with a flag indicating
    its pretended privacy and the addressable identifier )
  - Hosts a number of Private/Public key pair Curve25519 - NaCl-
  - Automatically discovers other nodes on the network after synchronizing
    with as little as one other host.
  - Synchronizes a directory of public keys mapped to recipient hosts with
    other nodes on the network.
  - Exposes public API allowing other nodes to send encrypted bytestrings to
    your node, and to synchronize, retrieving information about the nodes
    that your node knows about.
  - Exposes a private API which:
    - Allows you to send a bytestring to one or more public keys, returning
      a content-addressable identifier. This bytestring is encrypted
      transparently and efficiently (at symmetric encryption speeds) before
      being transmitted over the wire to the correct recipient nodes (and only
      those nodes.) The identifier is a hash digest of the encrypted payload
      that every receipient node receives. Each recipient node also receives a
      small blob encrypted for their public key which contains the Master Key
      for the encrypted payload.
    - Allows you to receive a decrypted bytestring based on an identifier.
      Payloads which your node has sent or received can be decrypted and retrieved
      in this way.

    - Exposes methods for deletion, resynchronization, and other management functions.

  - Supports a number of storage backends including LevelDB, BerkeleyDB, SQLite,
    and Directory/Maildir-style file storage suitable for use with any FUSE
    adapter, e.g. for AWS S3.

  - Uses mutually-authenticated TLS with modern settings and various trust
    models including hybrid CA/tofu (default), tofu (think OpenSSH), and
    whitelist (only some set of public keys can connect.)

  - Supports access controls like an IP whitelist.

ºRUNNINGº
- can be run as stand-alone daemon via constellation-node, or
  imported as a Haskell library, allowing to implement custom
  storage and encryption logic.

$ constellation-node "path_to_config_file" # or use ENV.VAR

@[https://medium.com/web3labs/announcing-crux-a-secure-enclave-for-quorum-61afbfdb79e4]
- dropin Constellation replacement
- secure enclave  written in Golang (Constellation is written in Haskell)
- <a href="https://github.com/blk-io/quorum-examples">7 nodes example deployment with Crux</a>
- LevelDB used as storage (same as geth).

@[https://github.com/synechron-finlabs/quorum-maker]
C&amp;P from https://github.com/synechron-finlabs/quorum-maker:
Synechron's Quorum Maker is a tool that allows users to create and manage Quorum network.
Manually editing configuration files and creating nodes is a slow and error-prone process.
Quorum Maker can create any number of nodes of various configurations dynamically with
reduced user input. This provides a wizard-like interface with a series of questions to
guide the user when creating nodes. Quorum Maker can create nodes to:

  - run with docker-compose (Raft consensus/Quorum 2.2.0) for easy use in development environments;
    or
  - nodes to be distributed on separate Linux boxes or cloud instances for a production environment
    (Raft consensus/Quorum 2.2.0)

ºINSTALL PRE-REQUISITESº
- install docker-CE ("Long Term Support") as explained in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">https://docs.docker.com/install/</a>

<span xsmall>Summary</span>
@[https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/]
@[https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline]

- B.P. is an approach to using the public Mainnet as a
  common frame of reference between systems, including traditional
  corporate systems of record, any kind of database or state machine,
  and even different blockchains or DLTs. It is particularly promising
  as a way to reduce capital expense and other overheads while
  increasing operational integrity when automating business processes
  across multiple companies.

(Pegasys Pantheon was renamed to Besu after joining the Hyperledger Fundation)
<span xsmall>Introduction</span>
- Java based, using VertX as core framework.
- Apache 2.0.
- Supports next consensus:
  - Eventual TX finality on Public Networks
    - Ethash PoW: Mainnet
    - Clique PoA: Goerli testnet
  - TX finality for private networks:
    - IBFT2: Needs 4+ nodes to really be IBFT, but fewer nodes
             are needed for "trusted" networks.
- Private TXs.
- GraphQL.
- OnChain permissioning of allowed TX-signers and allowed nodes
- OpenSource / Enterprise version.

"""@earizon Pantheon is designed to work for both public and private networks.
It’s not explicitly designed to be Quorum compatible, though it can sync to a
Clique or IBFT 1.0 Quorum network (but can NOT be a validator in an IBFT 1.0"
network). We do intend to support the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance spec which
I believe Quorum is also targetting to boost interoperability.  We’re still
fairly early in the benchmarking and performance improvement work for
Pantheon so I can’t put exact numbers on things.
ºCurrently Pantheon tends to be slower than Geth for syncingº
(especially since our fast sync is still under development) but is easily fast
enough to keep up with all the public networks.
Improving performance is a current focus... """

<span xsmall>Onchain Permissioning</span>
@[https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Permissioning/Onchain-Permissioning/]
Updated on 2020-03-20

- Permissioning smart contracts used to store and administer the
  node, account, and admin whitelists. (vs whitelists in config files with the
  potential to have errors or not bein in sync).

- Permissioning Management Dapp is located in repository
  PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts.

- Custom smart contracts and dapps can be implemented to work with
  onchain permissioning.

- Existing Permissioning contracts:
  -ºIngress contractsº: proxy contracts defined in the genesis file to defer the
   ºfor nodes andº      permissioning logic to the Node Rules and Account Rules contracts.
   ºaccountsº           The Ingress contracts deploy to static addresses.

  -ºNode Rulesº       : stores node whitelist and node whitelist operations
                       (for example, add and remove).

  -ºAccount Rulesº    : stores the accounts whitelist and account
                        whitelist operations (for example, add and remove).

  -ºAdminº            : stores the list of admin accounts and admin list
                        operations (for example, add and remove). There is one
                        list of admin accounts for node and accounts.

- Permissioning management Dapp:
  - provides view and maintain access to the whitelists.

- Whitelists implemented:
  - Accounts: can submit transactions to the network.
  - Nodes   : can join the network.
            ☞ All bootnodes must be on the nodes whitelist.
  - Admins  : accounts able to update the accounts and nodes whitelists

- Account permissioning Rºis incompatibleº with random key
  signing for privacy marker transactions.
  - A signing key must be specified using the
    [--privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key-file] cli flag,
    and also included in the accounts whitelist.

OºGas Limit Confº
  --target-gas-limit=$GAS_LIMIT_INTEGER
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Specifies the block gas limit toward which Besu will gradually move on an existing network,
   ºif enough miners are in agreement.º Use it to change the block gas limit set in the
    genesis fileºwithout creating a new networkº.
   ºThe gas limit between blocks can change only 1/1024thº, so this option tells the
    block creator how to set the gas limit in its block:
    - If the values are the same or within 1/1024th, the limit is set to the specified value.
    - Otherwise, the limit moves as far as it can within that constraint.
    - If not specified, block gas limit remains at the value specified in the genesis file.

OºFast syncº
  --sync-mode=FAST|FULL*
  WARN: FAST mode, most historical world state data is unavailable.
        Any methods attempting to access unavailable world state data return null.
  --fast-sync-min-peers=integer                     # Minimum peer number before start fast-sync. Default is 5.

BºQuorum 21 (2021-03-09):º
  (Enhanced Ethereum Mainnet Compatibility, lower infrastructure costs and ease of use)
  REF:
  @[https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/consensys-quorum-21-1-0-features-enhanced-ethereum-mainnet-compatibility/]
  - Enhanced compatibility between Besu and GoQuorum.

  - Besu mainnet Improvements for Network Upgrades, Database and Storage:

    - Compatibility with BºMainNet Berlin Network Upgradeº
      (next planned MainNet hard fork)
      -  addition of subroutines to the EVM,
      -  introduction of º"transaction envelopes"º making it simpler for Ethereum
         to support several different kinds of transactions
      -  changes in gas costs to increase the security of the network.
       RºWARNº: Use 21.1.2 or higher. Rº21.1.0 contains an outdated versionº of Berlin upgrade.
      -  Mainnet Launcher "wizard"
      -BºBonsai Triesº(Early Access): new database formatBºreducing storage requirementsº
         and improves performance for access to recent state.

         BºNON-BONSAI TRIES                 BONSAI TRIESº
           - multi-trie key/val store     - single trie.
                                          - one set of indexed leafs
                                          - N diffs that can be used
                                            to move the trie forward
                                            or backwards.
                                          --------------------------
                                          - reduce chain head count and
                                            state read and write amplification
                                          Bºfrom 10x-20x levels to 1x-2x for º
                                          Bºnon-committed access.º

                                          - Note: only full sync currently supported.

  -  New monitoring API detects nodes non initiating or receiving TX
     for a period-of-time andBºstops+hibernates them to reduce infra. cost.º

  -BºMulti-Tenancy in GoQuorum/Tessera nodesº.

Bº1.4º
@[https://pegasys.tech/introducing-plugin-apis-in-hyperledger-besu/]
@[https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/BESU-91?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel]
  └ BºPlugin APIº allows to fetch data from running Besu node:

    BESU node → (data) → (Besu 1.4+) → feed to DDBBs, kafka, ...
                ^^^^^^    Plugin-API
              - Blocks
              - Balances
              - Transactions
              - Smart Contracts
              - Execution Results
              - Logs
              - Syncing State

  └ future work: Besu will compartmentalize key supporting services, eventually
                 allowing them to be swapped via a plugin.
                 Ex: PegaSys Plus 1st release, made DDBB swappable to support
                     encryption at rest.

  └ privacy use in a Bºmulti-tenacyº environment;
  @[https://pegasys.tech/increase-adoption-and-cut-costs-with-multi-tenancy-on-hyperledger-besu/]
    (many clients re-using the same Ethereum client node
    whilst maintaining the privacy and confidentiality )
    with support for authenticated API access and allowing hosts who
    standup the infrastructure custom control on who to grant access to,
    at various levels of granularity depending on the
    users need, Bºcoupled with Orion private TX managerº.
    - By using BºJWT tokensº, a user identity is tied to a privacy
      identity, validating every API call to ensure the user
      is part of the privacy group before any data is revealed.
    (WiP for EthSigner and PegaSys Orchestrate multi-tenancy)

  └ Early access to flexible privacy groups allowing addition and
    removal of privacy group members;

  └ New tracing APIs
  └ Event Streaming Improvements
  └ Advanced Key Management
  └ Flexible privacy calls
  └ New privacy APIs
  └ End to end encryption with TLS links between PegaSys suite products


Bº1.2 Releaseº

    - Account-level Permissioning
      Limit transactions to trusted/known Ethereum accounts on your network.

  - Improved Privacy Groups:
    - Multiple ºprivacy groupsº with same membership can exist and be
      used for different purposes.
    - Names and description metadata can be embedded in privacy groups
      on-chain for clarity.

    - EthSigner for External Key Management
      - now compatible with Hashicorp KeyVault and Azure Key Vault):
      - Solve security issues created by storing key management
        mechanisms within the Ethereum Client. External key management
        through cloud or private stores.
      @[https://docs.ethsigner.pegasys.tech/en/latest/]

  - New Integrations and Upgrades
    - New GraphQL Interface:
      - Execute a whole set of common queries against Pantheon easier;

<span xsmall>Monitoring Performance</span>
(Prometh.+Grafana)
FROM @[https://gitter.im/PegaSysEng/pantheon] on 2019-05-29 20:01
- Adrian Sutton@ajsutton
  We've just published a Grafana dashboard as an example for
  monitoring Pantheon nodes:
  ºwhether they're in syncº, number of peers, cpu and memory usage etc.
  It'sºavailable at:º
  @[https://grafana.com/dashboards/10273] and instructions for
  setting up Pantheon and Prometheus is at
  @[https://pantheon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Using-Pantheon/Monitoring/#setting-up-and-running-prometheus-with-pantheon]
  ...
  I did sneak some extra metrics into trunk yesterday so the board
  work best with a build from master or anything from 1.1.2 onwards
  once it's released.


REF: @[https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/besu/message/34]
Re: How to Monitor Performance for Multiple Nodes?
...  you can use the promethus metrics server.
(--metrics-enabled and --metrics-categories=JVM,PROCESS).
In addition to enabling it you would need a prometheus server
to poll the metrics and something like grafana to make it presentable.

Here is a mechanical dump of all of the Prometheus metrics that we currently can export:

@[https://gist.github.com/shemnon/bff32ff78ff42cb2d51f76effba0d311]
Most relevant are the jvm_ and process_ metrics, which are standard prometheus names.

ING Bank:
...Launched in 2017, zero-knowledge range proof (ZKRP) enabled numerical
data to be validated within a number range. For example, a mortgage
applicant could prove that their salary sits within a certain range
without revealing the exact figure. A year later, ING took the
solution a step further and introduced ZKSM, which goes beyond
numerical data to include other types of information, like locations
and names. This made the new code, ZKSM, more powerful. For instance,
banks could validate that a new client lives in a country that
belongs to the European Union, without revealing the country. Simply
put, this allows for information to be shared without revealing

Improving Blockchain Performance Off-Chain, Hyperledger Announces Avalon
Oct 15, 2019 2 min read,
by Kent Weare

Hyperledger Avalon, which aims to enable the secure movement of
blockchain processing off the main chain to dedicated computing
resources, e.g. Intel SGX TEE. Avalon is designed to help developers
gain the benefits of computational trust to improve scalability and
confidentiality of the traditional blockchains. This a high-level
introduction focused on the project rationale and use cases.

Hyperledger Avalon is a broadly supported blockchain project and includes
involvement from organizations like Intel, iExec Blockchain Tech, Alibaba
Cloud, Baidu, Chainlink, ConsenSys, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle. The project
previously executed underneath the Trusted Compute Framework (TCF) name and
is a collaboration across the Hyperledger project, Enterprise Ethereum
Alliance and the cloud provider ecosystem.

Who is Who:
Eugene Yarmosh: systems architect at Intel, and has over 20 years
of experience designing and building distributed and decentralized
solutions spanning from embedded firmware to large-scale cloud
solutions. During the last several years, Eugene has focused on
scalability and privacy solutions for public and private blockchains,
specifically utilizing HW based trusted execution environments (TEE)
for off-chain workload execution. Eugene is an editor of the EEA
Off-chain Trusted Compute Specification and is a lead architect for
Hyperledger Avalon, a ledger-independent reference implementation of
the Trusted Compute specification. He also holds several patents.

<span xsmall>Optimistic VM (OVM)</span>
@[https://medium.com/plasma-group/introducing-the-ovm-db253287af50]
- VM designed to support all layer 2 (L2) protocols.  Its generality comes
from a reframing of L2 as an “optimistic” fork choice rule layered on top
of Ethereum. The formalization borrows heavily from CBC Casper research, and
describes layer 2 as a direct extension to layer 1 consensus. This implies a
possible unification of all “layer 2 scalability” constructions (Lightning,
Plasma, etc) under a single theory and virtual machine: the OVM.


See also:
@[https://medium.com/plasma-group/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-l2-optimistic-rollup-2c1cef2ec537]
Ethereum Smart Contracts in L2: Optimistic Rollup
This post outlines optimistic rollup:
-  a construction which enables autonomous smart contracts on layer 2 (L2)
using the OVM. The construction borrows heavily from both plasma and
zkRollup designs, and builds on shadow chains as described
by Vitalik.
 This construction resembles plasma but trades off some scalability
to enable running fully general (eg. Solidity) smart contracts in layer 2,
secured by layer 1. Scalability is proportional to the bandwidth of data
availability oracles which include Eth1, Eth2, or even Bitcoin Cash or ETC —
providing a near term scalable EVM-like chain in layer 2.

<span xsmall>AlphaWallet, Portis/ShapeShift</span>
<span xsmall>AlphaWallet TokenScripts ("Smart Tokens")</span>
- AlphaWallet is a production-ready white-label wallet that is easy to
  customize. TokenScript is similar to web frameworks used by web apps,
  combining the attributes of a blockchain-based token and the perks of
  a web app, allowing users to interact directly with
  blockchain-powered applications and services.

- It tries to solve the Trilemma "Security,Decentralization,Scalability".

- It consists of protocols chaining Dapss with Side Chains and "Main" Chains converting
  "value" into "tokens" than can be used in the AlphaWallet mobile platform.
  Its core strategy is to "move" as much as possible off-chain while keeping it only
  validation logic on-chain.

- A TokenScript file is made of:
  - JavaScript to make Token work in the user's wallet or across multiple apps; and
  - XML data to extract status and value of the token.

  In short, it's like a Bºsecure front-end for tokensº.

  Benefits
  - Run your tokens from users wallets as native, modular ‘Mini-DApps'
  - Extend token structure and realise rich functions with a single file
  - Portable across DApps
  - Sync updates at any time
  - Blockchain agnostic
  - Secure Enclave
  - DvP Security
  - Context based programming: User-experience
  - Attestation

- Who-is-Who:
  Wei Wu Zhang: head of development for AlphaWallet


- Portis is a self-custody blockchain wallet and Web3 access provider.
  It is powered by ShapeShift and provides access to multiple networks
  including Ethereum, Bitcoin, SKALE, xDai, and many others. It
  supports easy onboarding and user engagement and is trusted by a

"""I recently discovered a method to do generic proxying of Ethereum calls.
Skip further down for nitty gritty details, I’ll start this off with some
basics.
The problem
Sometimes, it’s convenient to build contract factories. For example, say you
want to implement crowdsourcing, or auctions, or games, or DAOs. In those
cases, instead of having one “Mother” auction which keeps track of active
auctions (which, in turn keep track of bidders, offers and items), it makes
sense to implement each auction/crowdfund/game/DAO as it’s own contract.

One problem is that these contracts are quite heavy; creating them may be
very expensive and the creation of several may be limited by block gas limits
. To counter this, the library-model can be used instead:

- Although there are many ways to categorise stablecoins, two distinct
  design concepts have stood out over time:
  - collateralized stablecoins:
    - Main categories:
      - crypto-collateralized (MakerDAO’s Dai)
      - fiat-collateralized tokens (Tether, BUSD, USDC)
    (both subgroups having had significant adoption).
  - algorithmic stablecoins :
    - attempt to change the circulating supply of the token
      so that changes in demand for the stablecoin minimally
      affect its price.
    - Bºnot collateralized or redeemable forº
      Bºan underlying asset.º
    - no significant traction (high profile attempts done):
      " ... We contend that a prevailing reason
        for the lack of traction of algorithmic
        stablecoins was not their economic

C⅋P from:
https://github.com/q9f/secp256k1.cr
- private keys are scalars
  public  keys are points with (x , y) coordinates.

- bitcoin public keys can be uncompressed #{p}#{x}#{y} or compressed
  #{p}#{x}. both come with a prefix p which is useless for uncompressed
  keys but necessary for compressed keys to recover the y coordinate on
  the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

- ethereum public keys are uncompressed #{x}#{y} without any prefix.
  the last 20 bytes slice of the y coordinate is actually used as
  address without any checksum. a checksum was later added in eip-55
  using a keccak256 hash and indicating character capitalization.

- neither bitcoin nor ethereum allow for recovering public keys from
  an address unless there exists a transaction with a valid signature
  on the blockchain.

escalability,cross-chain,ILP:
Peter Robinson of ConsenSys will discuss the General Purpose Atomic
Crosschain Transaction (GPACT), a protocol that allows composable
programming across multiple Ethereum blockchains. It allows for
inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both
synchronous and atomic -- if one part fails, the whole call graph of
function calls is rolled back. The protocol operates on existing
Ethereum blockchains without modification. It works for both public
permissioned and consortium blockchains. Additionally, the protocol
is expected to work across heterogeneous blockchains other than
Ethereum.

 The Deposit Smart Contract (DSC) is an instrumental component of the
Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 infrastructure. We have developed the first
machine-checkable version of the incremental Merkle tree algorithm
used in the DSC. We present our new and original correctness proof of
the algorithm along with the Dafny machine-checkable version. The
main results are: 1) a new proof of total correctness; 2) a software
artefact with the proof in the form of the complete Dafny code base
and 3) new provably correct optimisations of the algorithm.

https://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-security
Repository with some Ethereum security bugs. The bugs and fixes are demonstrated using Mocha tests.

Bugs added so far:
    Overflow
    Underflow
    Reentrancy (DAO hack)
    Delegatecall (Parity hack style)
    DOS (e.g. stay as an Auction leader forever)
    DOS (unbounded array loop)
    Force ether (relying on the invariant this.balance == 0)
    Tx.origin
    Unchecked send() output
    Storage override (commonly used in honeypots - or genuine bugs)
    Array storage override (length underflow - storage override)
    extcodesize bypassed when used to check if the caller is a contract
