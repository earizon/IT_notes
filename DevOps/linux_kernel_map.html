     other operating systems in the same class. The most prominent one is HAMMER, our modern 
     high performance filesystem with built-in mirroring and historic access functionality."

    Steven Rostedt, Open Source Programmer at VMware, maintains the Real Time 
    Stable releases of the Linux kernel, among other things. Rostedt is one of 
    the original developers of the PREEMPT_RT patch and began working on it in 
    2004 with the goal of turning Linux into a real-time designed operating system
    . He is also the main author, developer, and maintainer of Ftrace, a tool 
    designed to help developers find what is going on inside the kernel. 
    According to the Ftrace wiki, the tool can be used for debugging or analyzing 
    latencies and performance issues that take place outside of user-space.

  <li><a href="http://www.openmirage.org/">Mirage OS</a>
      Mirage OS is a library operating system that constructs unikernels
      for secure, high-performance network applications across a variety
      of cloud computing and mobile platforms.  Code can be developed on a normal OS
      such as Linux or MacOS X, and then compiled into a fully-standalone,
      specialised unikernel that runs under the Xen hypervisor.</li>
  <li><a href="http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/">Fiasco</a>
      Fiasco is a µ-kernel (microkernel) running on various platforms.

       The Fiasco.OC kernel can be used to construct flexible systems. Fiasco.OC is the base for our 
      TUDO:OS system which supports running real-time, time-sharing and virtualization applications 
      concurrently on one computer.  However, Fiasco.OC is both suitable for big and complex systems,
       but also for small, embedded applications. We have developed the L4 Runtime Environment which
       provides the necessary infrastructure on top of Fiasco.OC for conveniently developing applications.
       Please refer to the Features page for more information on the capabilities of Fiasco.OC.
      
      Fiasco is a preemptible real-time kernel supporting hard priorities.  It uses non-blocking 
      synchronization for its kernel objects.  This guarantees priority inheritance and makes sure
      that runnable high-priority processes never block waiting for lower-priority processes.

From "SELinux By Example": """An FC4 system has more than 40 kernel SElinux object classes representing all the resources provided by the kernel. The number of object classes illustrates a basic philosophy in SELinux to represent the kernel resources as completely and accurately as possible. The richness and complexity of Linux means that this accurate representation is necessarily rich and complex itself. This complexity may seem daunting, but it is necessary to give SELinux the flexibility to fully address the security challenges facing Linux. Tools and technology are emerging that use the richness of SELinux to provide sophisticated security without the user needing to be aware of the underlying complexity.

To ease understanding, we divide the kernel object classes into four categories: file-related, network-related, System V IPC, and miscellaneous"""
