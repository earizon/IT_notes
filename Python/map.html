BºJupyterº
  - web application,  server-client structure which is free, open-source, and easy to use.
    Its name is a reference to three core programming languages supported by Jupyter:
    Julia, Python, and R. But Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages!

 - next generation JupyterLab launched in 2018. 
   It is a web-based IDE for data science.

 - Interactive output
 - You can create great notebooks containing visualizations, markdown 
   text explanations, even Latex equations!
 - It brings the terminal, text editor, console, and file directory view "toghether".
   with a flexible layout.
 - magic commands and notebook extensions augment the functionalities. Ex:
   auto-formatting, debugging, autosave, auto code completion, ...
   There is even a zen mode extension to minimize distractions and maximize productivity!

   Productive Jupyter Notebook Hacks, Tips and Tricks!:
   https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/04/10-productive-jupyter-notebook-hacks-tips-tricks/

<span xsmall>Zen of programming</span>
- Avoid the Billion dolar mistake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">[more info]</a>
  Don't use Null/None values. Use default values instead.

- Premature optimization is the root of all evil 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize">[More info]</a>
    Don't expend time saving CPU instructions until you are sure that such instructions
    are executed hundreds of thousands of times in a seconds for long periods of time.
    HINT: In most scenarios, your CPU waste more time idle waiting for data that processing it.
          Put you data close to your CPU to make things "run fast".
          (GPU work fast by using many slow CPUs with isolated RAM close to each CPU )

- Inmutable structures will not fail once build. Mutable will (sometimes).

- An exception that can be fixed in code is not an exception, is a 
  contemplated state. (It's just an state that you don't like that 
  much). Use normal return values indicating the contemplated state
  - An exception that can NOT be fixed, can NOT be fixed.
  - If the software is wrong, your program must inform the 
    developer (assert, log and popup "sorry the developer is an idiot")
  - If the hardware/network is wrong, your program  must inform the 
    IT admin (log and popup "sorry, it's not your fault, System admin is an idiot")
  - If the user is wrong, your program must inform the user 
    (popup "sorry, you are an idiot")

- What you call a "CPU" is actually a Turing Machine @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine]:
  - A Turing Machine is single threaded and operates on a single tape.
  - All the infinite algorithms that one can imagine are single 
    threaded and can be resolved by a Turing Machine with enough memory 
    and time (maybe infinite memory and time).
  - Multiprocess means "many turing machines running at the same time".
  - Multihread means "many turing machines fighting each other",
    but in rare occasions threads can be orchestated to build a
    new and faster Turing Machine. If you don't now what that means
    DO NOT USE thread.
  - In case of doubt, do NOT use multithread
  - I cheated you. The Turing machine doesn't exists. Real CPUs needs data 
    from external systems and writes computation results
    to external systems. That's what we call I/O (Input/Output).
  - If data takes time to arrive you can try to use the
    Touring Machine for other tasks for which input data is
    already available. That's what we call Asyncrhonous I/O.
  - Algorithms plus data structures == Program

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than ºrightº now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<span xsmall>Context Manager("with")</span>
<span xsmall></span>
ºwithº
- A context manager is an object (file objects, ...) that is notified when a context 
  ("block of code") starts and ends.
- When a context ends, the file object is closed automatically:
- The "with" statement takes care of the notifying.

01 with open(filename) as openFile:
02     file_contents = openFile.read()
03 ...       #  ← here openFile is closed

<span xsamll>Float/Decimal/Fraction</span>
Float   : follows IEEE 754 ("C") fast but with finite precission.
Decimal : arbitrary precission. Represents number like an integer (default to 28 possition).
          Recommended for Finances (precission known a priori)
Fraction: Any rational number. Stores as two numbers. 

from decimal import Decimal
from fractions import Fraction

a1 = 0.1    | a2 = Decimal('0.1') | a3 = Fraction(1,10)
b1 = 0.2    | b2 = Decimal('0.2') | b3 = Fraction(2,10)

<pre zoom TODO>
<span xsmall>Exception Handling</span>
Exceptions are raised with a raise statement. In code, a raise statement consists of the following:

def functA(...):
    if assertValue == False:
       ºraiseº Exception('This is the error message.')

try:
    functA(sym, w, h)
except Exception as err:
    print f('trapped exception {err}')   # ← Print exception
    with open('log.txt', 'w') as fA:     
        fA.write(traceback.format_exc()) # ← Write traceback to file


<span xsmall>Assertions</span>
In plain English, an assert statement says, 
"I assert that this condition holds true, and if not,
 ºthere is a bug somewhere in the program.º"

Bºcode should not handle assert statements with try and except.º
  It must fail-fast and crash!!
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast]


Ex Ussage:
status = 'open'
assert status == 'open', 'Status expected to be "open"'

Assertions can be disabled by passing theº-Oºoption flag

                   #   By default it will import pdb and call pdb.set_trace()

                   #   BºPYTHONBREAKPOINTº can be used to modify the default behaviour

    PYTHONBREAKPOINT=pudb.set_trace python3.7 start.py
                     ^^^^
                     - equivalent to replacing breakpoint() by
                       import pudb ; pudb.set_trace()
                     - Pudb is a (much better) alternative to pdb library and
                       interactive console debugger. To install it:
                       $ºsudo pip3 install pudbº
                       @[https://pypi.org/project/pudb/]
  
    PYTHONBREAKPOINT=web_pdb.set_trace python3.7 appServer.py
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
                    ºremote debugging and threadsº
                     - When deploying server apps most probably they are
                       not executed from the command-line, but from gevent, WSGI, ....
                       breakpoint() will call a new web_pdb.set_trace() service
                       listening on localhost:5555.  web-pdb is a remote web debugger.

<span xsmall TODO >Logging</span>
To enable the logging module to display log messages on your screen 
as your program runs, copy the following to the top of your program 
(but under the #! python shebang line):

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s- %(message)s')

Say you wrote a function to calculate the factorial of a number. In 
mathematics, factorial 4 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4, or 24. Factorial 7 is 1 
× 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7, or 5,040. Open a new file editor 
window and enter the following code. It has a bug in it, but you will 
also enter several log messages to help yourself figure out what is 
going wrong. Save the program as factorialLog.py.

BºLOGGING LEVELS:º
  logging.debug() 
  logging.info()  
  logging.warning()
  logging.error()    
  logging.critical()

Disabling Logging

After you’ve debugged your program, you probably don’t want all these log messages cluttering the screen. The logging.disable() function disables these so that you don’t have to go into your program and remove all the logging calls by hand.

˃˃˃ import logging

˃˃˃ logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=' %(asctime)s -%(levelname)s - %(message)s')

˃˃˃ logging.critical('Critical error! Critical error!')
2015-05-22 11:10:48,054 - CRITICAL - Critical error! Critical error!

˃˃˃ logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)

˃˃˃ logging.critical('Critical error! Critical error!')

˃˃˃ logging.error('Error! Error!')

Logging to a File

Instead of displaying the log messages to the screen, you can write them to a text file. The logging.basicConfig() function takes a filename keyword argument, like so:

import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='myProgramLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

<span xsmall>itertools</span>
- collection of tools intented to be fast and use memory
  efficiently when handling iterators (like lists or dictionaries).

From the official Python 3.x documentation:

    The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools
that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an
"iterator algebra" making it possible to construct specialized tools
succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.

The itertools module comes in the standard library and must be imported.

The operator module will also be used. This module is not necessary when 
using itertools, but needed for some of the examples below.

-ºaccumulate(iterable[, func])º: Makes an iterator that returns the results of a function.
            ^^^^^^^^
            Defaults to sum
   
Ex: 
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = itertools.accumulate(data, operator.mul)
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
                                    takes current and "next" element 
                                    and multiplies them
                                    

-ºcombinations(iterable, r)º: creates all the unique combination that have r members. Ex:
-ºcombinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)º ← allows individual elements to be repeated more than once 

shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square',]
result1 = itertools.combinations(shapes, 2)
result2 = itertools.combinations(shapes, 2)
for each in result1:
   print(each)      ← ('circle', 'triangle') ('circle', 'square') ('triangle', 'square')
for each in result1:
   print(each)      ← ('circle', 'circle') ('circle', 'triangle') ('circle', 'square')
                      ('triangle', 'triangle') ('triangle', 'square') ('square', 'square')

-ºcount(start=0, step=1)º : Creates new iterator returning evenly spaced values.
for i in itertools.count(10,3): ← 10 13 16 19 22
   print(i)
   if i ˃ 20:
       break

-ºcycle(iterable)º: function cycling through an iterator endlessly.
colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']
for color in itertools.cycle(colors): ← red orange yellow red orange ...
   print(color)

-ºchain(*iterables)º: Take a series of iterables and return them as one long iterable. Ex:

colors = ['red', 'orange']
shapes = ['circle', 'triangle']
result = itertools.chain(colors, shapes) ← red orange circle triangle


-ºcompress(data, selectors)º: Filters one iterable with another.
shapes     = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square', 'pentagon']
selections = [True,     False,      True,     False]
itertools.compress(shapes, selections)   ← ['circle', 'square']

-ºdropwhile(predicate, iterable)º: Make an iterator that drops elements from
                                   the iterable as long as the predicate is true; 
                                   afterwards, returns every element. Ex:
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]
result = itertools.dropwhile(lambda x: x˂5, data)
for each in result: ← 5 6 7 8 9 10 1
   ...

-ºfilterfalse(predicate, iterable)º: Makes an iterator that filters elements from
                                     iterable returning only those for which the predicate 
                                     is False. Ex.:
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = itertools.filterfalse(lambda x: x˂5, data)
for each in result:  ← 5 6 7 8 9 10
   ...

-ºitertools.groupby(iterable, key=None)º: groups things together. 
                                          Actually is works like UNIX 'uniq', since it groups
                                          only when current and next element match. Ex:


robots = [
  { 'id': 'blas', 't': 'type1'    },
  { 'id': 'galv', 't': 'type2' },
  { 'id': 'jazz', 't': 'type1'    },
  { 'id': 'metr', 't': 'type1'    },
  { 'id': 'mega', 't': 'type2' },
  { 'id': 'star', 't': 'type2' }
]
for key, group in itertools.groupby(robots, key=lambda x: x['t']):
   print(key, list(group))
   ^^^^^   output   ^^^^^^
           vvvvvv
type1 [{'id': 'blas', 't': 'type1'}]
type2 [{'id': 'galv', 't': 'type2'}]
type1 [{'id': 'jazz', 't': 'type1'}, {'id': 'metr', 't': 'type1'}]
type2 [{'id': 'mega', 't': 'type2'}, {'id': 'star', 't': 'type2'}]

-ºislice(iterable, start, stop[, step])º: "very much" like slices, it allows 
                                          to cut out a piece of an iterable. Ex:
colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue',]
itertools.islice(colors, 2) ← 'red', 'orange'

-ºpermutations(iterable, r=None)º . Ex:
input_l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for each in itertools.permutations(input_l)
    ....    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            ('a', 'b', 'c')
            ('a', 'c', 'b')
            ('b', 'a', 'c')
            ('b', 'c', 'a')
            ('c', 'a', 'b')
            ('c', 'b', 'a')
    

-ºproductº: Creates the cartesian products from a series of iterables.
num_data   = [1, 2, 3]
alpha_data = ['a', 'b', 'c']
result = itertools.product(num_data, alpha_data)
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         (1, 'a') (1, 'b') (1, 'c')
         (2, 'a') (2, 'b') (2, 'c')
         (3, 'a') (3, 'b') (3, 'c')
-ºrepeat(object[, times])º: repeat time 'times' (or "forever" in times not included)
itertools.repeat("Hello", 3)  ← Hello Hello Hello

-ºstarmap(function, iterable)º: Makes an iterator that computes the function using 
                                arguments obtained from the iterable. Ex.:
data = [(2, 6), (8, 4), (7, 3)]
result = itertools.starmap(operator.mul, data) ← 12 32 21

-ºtakewhile(predicate, iterable)º: opposite of dropwhile(). Creates new iterator returning
                                   elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true. Ex.:
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]
itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x˂5, data) ← 1 2 3 4 

-ºtee(iterable, n=2)º: Return n independent iterators from a single iterable.
iterable1, iterable2 = itertools.tee(colors_l) 

-ºzip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None)º: "Zip" *iterables in tuples. Iteration continues until
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    the longest iterable is exhausted.  Ex:
                Used when *iterables is uneven
                or of different length.

colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ]
itertools.zip_longest(colors, data, fillvalue=None) ← ('red', 1) ('orange', 2) ('yellow', 3) (None, 4) (None, 5)

ºGreedy vs Nongreedy Matchingº

Python’s regular expressions are greedy by default, which means 
that in ambiguous situations they will match the longest string 
possible. The non-greedy version of the curly brackets, which matches 
the shortest string possible, has the closing curly bracket followed 
by a question mark.

˃˃˃ greedy_ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}')
˃˃˃ mo1 = greedy_ha_regex.search('HaHaHaHaHa')
˃˃˃ mo1.group()
'HaHaHaHaHa'

˃˃˃ nongreedy_ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}?')
˃˃˃ mo2 = nongreedy_ha_regex.search('HaHaHaHaHa')
˃˃˃ mo2.group()
'HaHaHa'

The findall Method

In addition to the search() method, Regex objects also have a 
findall() method. While search() will return a Match object of the 
first matched text in the searched string, the findall() method will 
return the strings of every match in the searched string.

˃˃˃ phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d') # has no groups

˃˃˃ phone_num_regex.findall('Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000')
['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000']

To summarize what the findall() method returns, remember the following:

    When called on a regex with no groups, such as 
\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d, the method findall() returns a list of ng 
matches, such as ['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000'].

    When called on a regex that has groups, such as 
(\d\d\d)-d\d)-(\d\ d\d\d), the method findall() returns a list of es 
of strings (one string for each group), such as [('415', ', '9999'), 
('212', '555', '0000')].

Making Your Own Character Classes

There are times when you want to match a set of characters but the 
shorthand character classes (\d, \w, \s, and so on) are too broad. 
You can define your own character class using square brackets. For 
example, the character class [aeiouAEIOU] will match any vowel, both 
lowercase and uppercase.

˃˃˃ vowel_regex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]')

˃˃˃ vowel_regex.findall('Robocop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.')
['o', 'o', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'o', 'o', 'A', 'O', 'O']

You can also include ranges of letters or numbers by using a hyphen. 
For example, the character class [a-zA-Z0-9] will match all lowercase 
letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.

By placing a caret character (^) just after the character class’s 
opening bracket, you can make a negative character class. A negative 
character class will match all the characters that are not in the 
character class. For example, enter the following into the 
interactive shell:

˃˃˃ consonant_regex = re.compile(r'[^aeiouAEIOU]')

˃˃˃ consonant_regex.findall('Robocop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.')
['R', 'b', 'c', 'p', ' ', 't', 's', ' ', 'b', 'b', 'y', ' ', 'f', 
'd', '.', '
', 'B', 'B', 'Y', ' ', 'F', 'D', '.']

The Caret and Dollar Sign Characters

    You can also use the caret symbol (^) at the start of a regex to 
indicate that a match must occur at the beginning of the searched 
text.

    Likewise, you can put a dollar sign ($) at the end of the regex 
to indicate the string must end with this regex pattern.

    And you can use the ^ and $ together to indicate that the entire 
string must match the regex—that is, it’s not enough for a match 
to be made on some subset of the string.

The r'^Hello' regular expression string matches strings that begin 
with 'Hello':

˃˃˃ begins_with_hello = re.compile(r'^Hello')

˃˃˃ begins_with_hello.search('Hello world!')
˂_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'˃

˃˃˃ begins_with_hello.search('He said hello.') is None
True

The r'\d$' regular expression string matches strings that end with a numeric character from 0 to 9:

˃˃˃ whole_string_is_num = re.compile(r'^\d+$')

˃˃˃ whole_string_is_num.search('1234567890')
˂_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 10), match='1234567890'˃

˃˃˃ whole_string_is_num.search('12345xyz67890') is None
True

˃˃˃ whole_string_is_num.search('12 34567890') is None
True

The Wildcard Character

The . (or dot) character in a regular expression is called a wildcard and will match any character except for a newline:

˃˃˃ at_regex = re.compile(r'.at')

˃˃˃ at_regex.findall('The cat in the hat sat on the flat mat.')
['cat', 'hat', 'sat', 'lat', 'mat']

Matching Everything with Dot-Star

˃˃˃ name_regex = re.compile(r'First Name: (.º) Last Name: (.º)')

˃˃˃ mo = name_regex.search('First Name: Al Last Name: Sweigart')

˃˃˃ mo.group(1)
'Al'

˃˃˃ mo.group(2)
'Sweigart'

The dot-star uses greedy mode: It will always try to match as much 
text as possible. To match any and all text in a nongreedy fashion, 
use the dot, star, and question mark (.*?). The question mark tells 
Python to match in a nongreedy way:

˃˃˃ nongreedy_regex = re.compile(r'˂.*?˃')
˃˃˃ mo = nongreedy_regex.search('˂To serve man˃ for dinner.˃')
˃˃˃ mo.group()
'˂To serve man˃'

˃˃˃ greedy_regex = re.compile(r'˂.*˃')
˃˃˃ mo = greedy_regex.search('˂To serve man˃ for dinner.˃')
˃˃˃ mo.group()
'˂To serve man˃ for dinner.˃'

Matching Newlines with the Dot Character

The dot-star will match everything except a newline. By passing 
re.DOTALL as the second argument to re.compile(), you can make the 
dot character match all characters, including the newline character:

˃˃˃ no_newline_regex = re.compile('.*')
˃˃˃ no_newline_regex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.').group()
'Serve the public trust.'

˃˃˃ newline_regex = re.compile('.*', re.DOTALL)
˃˃˃ newline_regex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.').group()
'Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.'

Review of Regex Symbols
Symbol  Matches
?   zero or one of the preceding group.
*   zero or more of the preceding group.
+   one or more of the preceding group.
{n}     exactly n of the preceding group.
{n,}    n or more of the preceding group.
{,m}    0 to m of the preceding group.
{n,m}   at least n and at most m of the preceding p.
{n,m}? or *? or +?  performs a nongreedy match of the preceding p.
^spam   means the string must begin with spam.
spam$   means the string must end with spam.
.   any character, except newline characters.
\d, \w, and \s  a digit, word, or space character, resectively.
\D, \W, and \S  anything except a digit, word, or space acter, respectively.
[abc]   any character between the brackets (such as a, b, ).
[^abc]  any character that isn’t between the brackets.
Case-Insensitive Matching

To make your regex case-insensitive, you can pass re.IGNORECASE or 
re.I as a second argument to re.compile():

˃˃˃ robocop = re.compile(r'robocop', re.I)

˃˃˃ robocop.search('Robocop is part man, part machine, all cop.').group()
'Robocop'

˃˃˃ robocop.search('ROBOCOP protects the innocent.').group()
'ROBOCOP'

˃˃˃ robocop.search('Al, why does your programming book talk about robocop so much?').group()
'robocop'

Substituting Strings with the sub() Method

The sub() method for Regex objects is passed two arguments:

    The first argument is a string to replace any matches.
    The second is the string for the regular expression.

The sub() method returns a string with the substitutions applied:

˃˃˃ names_regex = re.compile(r'Agent \w+')

˃˃˃ names_regex.sub('CENSORED', 'Agent Alice gave the secret documents to Agent Bob.')
'CENSORED gave the secret documents to CENSORED.'

Another example:

˃˃˃ agent_names_regex = re.compile(r'Agent (\w)\w*')

˃˃˃ agent_names_regex.sub(r'\1ºººº', 'Agent Alice told Agent Carol that Agent Eve knew Agent Bob was a double agent.')
Aºººº told Cºººº that Eºººº knew Bºººº was a double agent.'

Managing Complex Regexes

To tell the re.compile() function to ignore whitespace and comments 
inside the regular expression string, “verbose mode” can be 
enabled by passing the variable re.VERBOSE as the second argument to 
re.compile().

Now instead of a hard-to-read regular expression like this:

phone_regex = re.compile(r'((\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?(\s|-|\.)?\d{3}(\s|-|\.)\d{4}(\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*\d{2,5})?)')

you can spread the regular expression over multiple lines with comments like this:

phone_regex = re.compile(r'''(
    (\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?            # area code
    (\s|-|\.)?                    # separator
    \d{3}                         # first 3 digits
    (\s|-|\.)                     # separator
    \d{4}                         # last 4 digits
    (\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*\d{2,5})?  # extension
    )''', re.VERBOSE)

º__main__ º
Top-level script environment

__main__ is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A 
module’s name is set equal to __main__ when read from standard 
input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.

A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope 
by checking its own __name__, which allows a common idiom for 
conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script 
or with python -m but not when it is imported:

˃˃˃ if __name__ == "__main__":
...     # execute only if run as a script
...     main()

For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a main.py 
module, the contents of which will be executed when the module is run 
with -m.

For example we are developing script which is designed to be used as 
module, we should do:

˃˃˃ # Python program to execute function directly
˃˃˃ def add(a, b):
...     return a+b
...
˃˃˃ add(10, 20) # we can test it by calling the function save it as calculate.py
30
˃˃˃ # Now if we want to use that module by importing we have to comment out our call,
˃˃˃ # Instead we can write like this in calculate.py
˃˃˃ if __name__ == "__main__":
...     add(3, 5)
...
˃˃˃ import calculate
˃˃˃ calculate.add(3, 5)
8

Advantages
  Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is 
  __main__, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the 
  user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
  If you import this script as a module in another script, the name 
  is set to the name of the script/module.
  Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone 
  programs.
  if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if 
   the file was run directly, and not imported.

<span xsmall bgorange>setup.py</span>
The setup script is the centre of all activity in building, 
distributing, and installing modules using the Distutils. The main 
purpose of the setup script is to describe your module distribution 
to the Distutils, so that the various commands that operate on your 
modules do the right thing.

The setup.py file is at the heart of a Python project. It describes 
all of the metadata about your project. There a quite a few fields 
you can add to a project to give it a rich set of metadata describing 
the project. However, there are only three required fields: name, 
version, and packages. The name field must be unique if you wish to 
publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The version 
field keeps track of different releases of the project. The packages 
field describes where you’ve put the Python source code within your 
project.

This allows you to easily install Python packages. Often it's enough 
to write:

python setup.py install

and module will install itself.

Our initial setup.py will also include information about the license 
and will re-use the README.txt file for the long_description field. 
This will look like:

˃˃˃ from distutils.core import setup
˃˃˃ setup(
...    name='pythonCheatsheet',
...    version='0.1',
...    packages=['pipenv',],
...    license='MIT',
...    long_description=open('README.txt').read(),
... )

  ºRWARN,WARN,WARN:º Read also (exaggerated but still pertinent) critics @
  @[https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/]

Bºpipenv Summaryº:
  - Install a virtual Python environment inside a given (development) directory:  
  - Python equivalent to other package managers:
    (Ruby bundler, PHP-composer, NodeJS npm|yarn, RUST-cargo,...)
  - Reports dependency graph.
  - Streamline development workflow by loading .env files.
  

BºPRE-SETUP-STEP 1) INSTALL PIPENVº (Just once)
  $ sudo pip3 install        pipenv     # alt 1: For all users
  $      pip3 install --user pipenv     # alt 2: For current-user
                                                PATH must include current-user base.
                                                (Check it with "python -m site --user-base" 
                                                 Output will be similar to /home/myuser/.local )

ºThe main goal of SQLAlchemy is to change the way you think about databases and SQL!º

- full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,
  designed for efficient and high-performing database access.

SQLALCHEMY'S PHILOSOPHY
- SQL databases behave less like object collections the more size and 
  performance start to matter; object collections behave less like tables and 
  rows the more abstraction starts to matter. SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate 
  both of these principles.

- SQLAlchemy considers the database to be a relational algebra engine,
  not just a collection of tables. Rows can be selected from not only tables
  but also joins and other select statements; any of these units can be
  composed into a larger structure.

- SQLAlchemy's overall approach to ORM is entirely different from that of
  most other SQL / ORM tools, rooted in a so-called complimentarity- oriented
  approach; instead of hiding away SQL and object relational details behind a 
  wall of automation, all processes are fully exposed within a series of 
  composable, transparent tools. The library takes on the job of automating 
  redundant tasks while the developer remains in control of how the database is 
  organized and how SQL is constructed.

- Falcon is a blazing fast, minimalist Python web API framework for 
  building reliable app backends and microservices.
  Falcon compiles itself with Cython when available, and 
  also works well with PyPy.


  s a WSGI server and performs a GET request directly on each 
framework's PEP-3333 app. Requests are not sent over the network, 
since the performance of a given network or web server is not related 
to the performance of the WSGI frameworks themselves. Regardless, 
each app parses a route template with a single embedded parameter, 
reads a query parameter and a header from the request data, sets an 
x-header on the response, and finally returns a 10 KiB body, randomly 
generated.

  Method. 50,000 iterations were executed per trial (100,000 for the 
PyPy tests), and the best time was recorded for each framework over 
20 trials. The order in which the frameworks were tested was 
randomized for each trial. Also, garbage collection was enabled as it 
would be in a production environment, and a full collection was 
forcefully triggered before each trial. Finally, results were 
calculated using the Decimal class, and rounded to the nearest whole 
number.

  Platform. Benchmarks were executed by running the corresponding 
Docker images on a Google Compute Engine instance (Intel Skylake, 
1vCPU, 2 GB RAM), running Ubuntu 18.04 with all system packages 
updated to their latest versions as of May 2019. The frameworks were

https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics
Asciimatics is a package to help people create full-screen text UIs 
(from interactive forms to ASCII animations) on any platform. It is 
licensed under the Apache Software Foundation License 2.0.

"...It brings a little joy to anyone who was programming in the 80s..."

Oh and it provides a single cross-platform Python class to do 
all the low-level console function you could ask for, including:

  - Coloured/styled text - including 256 colour terminals and unicode 
    characters (even CJK languages)
  - Cursor positioning
  - Keyboard input (without blocking or echoing) including unicode 
    support
  - Mouse input (terminal permitting)
  - Detecting and handling when the console resizes
  - Screen scraping

In addition, it provides some simple, high-level APIs to provide more 
complex features including:

  - Anti-aliased ASCII line-drawing
  - Image to ASCII conversion - including JPEG and GIF formats
  - Many animation effects - e.g. sprites, particle systems, banners, 
    etc.
  - Various widgets for text UIs - e.g. buttons, text boxes, radio 
    buttons, etc.

- This package has been proven to work on CentOS 6 & 7, Raspbian 
  (i.e. Debian wheezy), Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 7, 8 & 10, OSX 
  10.11 and Android Marshmallow (courtesy of https://termux.com), 
- It should also work for any other platform that provides a 
  working curses implementation.

https://github.com/robinhood/faust
Faust is a stream processing library, porting the ideas from Kafka 
Streams to Python.

It is used at Robinhood to build high performance distributed systems 
and real-time data pipelines that process billions of events every 
day.

Faust provides both stream processing and event processing, sharing 
similarity with tools such as Kafka Streams, Apache 
Spark/Storm/Samza/Flink,

It does not use a DSL, it's just Python! This means you can use all 
your favorite Python libraries when stream processing: NumPy, 
PyTorch, Pandas, NLTK, Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy, ++

https://pypi.org/project/hachoir/
Hachoir is a Python library to view and edit a binary stream field by 
field. In other words, Hachoir allows you to “browse” any binary 
stream just like you browse directories and files.

A file is splitted in a tree of fields, where the smallest field is 
just one bit. Examples of fields types: integers, strings, bits, 
padding types, floats, etc. Hachoir is the French word for a meat 
grinder (meat mincer), which is used by butchers to divide meat into 
long tubes; Hachoir is used by computer butchers to divide binary 
files into fields.

@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/google-python-atheris-fuzzing/]
Google recently announced the open-sourcing of a new fuzzy testing 
engine for Python. The new fuzzer, Atheris, strives to find bugs in 
Python code and native extensions in Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+. 
Atheris can be used in combination with the Address Sanitizer and 
Undefined Behavior Sanitizer tools that detect memory corruption bugs 
and undefined behavior (e.g., buffer overflows, misaligned or null 
pointers).

Sql queries on CSV files with csvkit
Write SQL queries on your CSV file.My life would have been so much more easier at one of my previous jobs if I had found this back then!A python package called csvkit allows you to run SQL queries on your CSV file without having to push the data to a database.What's more, you can use it directly from your command line as well.Here are 2 simple steps to do it:1. Install the package with pip install csvkit.2. Run csvsql --query "SQL_QUERY" filename.csv on the command line.That's it!If you have a CSV and a readily available SQL and if you want to run the SQL on the data in the CSV but not push it to a DB, Csvkit is your friend!Try it out the next time you quickly want to query your CSV files!################################3Python: 30nsecs of codehttps://www.30secondsofcode.org/python/t/string/p/2
