<h2>A brief introduction</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" target="_new">Mind maps</a> are great at displaying 
  related topics toghether ("bird's eye view") but they fail to provide concrete information 
  about the topics themself</li>

  <li><a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet">Cheat-sheets</a> are great at providing 
    daily-usage for a given tool, procedure, task, ... but fail to provide the global mind-map picture
    in a bigger context</li>

  <li>Books are great for learning purposes but they are "bloated" with educational content
    that is not very useful in repeated reads ("experts consults") and not very conformtable to
    work with for daily use, specially when we just want to query some "how-to" time-to-time.<br/>
    This is worse with electronic book formats like PDFs, WORDs or e-books since moving around is quite 
    un-confortable on computer screens when compared to printed paper.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  The Single-Page-Book format (SPB) try to fix those shortcommings providing the 
  best of all worlds.<br/>
   <ul>
  <li>A (properly written) single-page-book will offer all the advantages of mind-maps,
  cheat-sheats and books.</li>
  <li>The SPB "dynamically" allows to zoom into details or orbit around the
      content with easy "a la Google Maps" and search/filter content quickly.
      Most importantly it allows to inspect related content by browsing the 
      neighborhood.<br/>
      
      <span style='font-size:1.3em; color:orange'> that important neighborhood-content 
      that <span style="text-decoration:underline">
      <span style="font-size:2em;">👉</span>we will not search for, not even
      on Google<span style="font-size:2em;">👈</span>, 
      because its part of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">"unknown-unknowns"</span></span>.
  </li>
  <li>SPBs will allow to store <b>as much information as possible no more than one click away</b>
  avoiding random searchs in Google/cheat-seats/emails/blogs/crystal balls/...
  </li>
  </ul>
 
  The SPB format can also be used for many other purposes that I did not contemplated
  when starting the project.<br/>
   As an example I'm using a SPB formated page as my <b>browser home-page to store all sort 
  of "random" things</b> like contacts, bookmarks, projects and project canvas, work-in-progress, task-lists,
  pending payments, home accountancy, travel-management, medical data, project-management,
  resource-planning, english and french vocabulary, secret-key-store, etc ... <br/>
   A moderm text-editor is all that needed to keep the info up-to-date
  and accesible with one click.  vim, notepad++, ultraedit, ... or any other
  with support for macros is all that needed (and of course web browser).
  <br/> <br/>

  Indirectly <b>SPB promote "best-pattern" approach to documentation</b> by:
  <ul>
  <li><span style="font-size:2em">👊</span>Putting related info close to each other. Actually a single html text file will be used.</li>
  <li><span style="font-size:2em">👊</span>Don't repeat twice. This is easier once the previously spread information is 
      located in a single file.</li>
  <li><span style="font-size:2em">👊</span>Don't keep notes spread(hidden) amongst hundred of emails.</li>
  <li><span style="font-size:2em">👊</span>Don't hide important information digged behind random menus paths 
      and children pages:<br/>
      Again, the risk of the Unknown Unknowns</b>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">(Wikipedia entry)</a>
      can also be applied to documentation:<br/>
      <b>People will not search for important information until they are aware that such important
      information exists</b>, so we better place important information right into the main page.
      <br/>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-size:2em">👊</span>Don't use propietary formats for important documentation: <br/>
      HTML will be well supported in any electronic platform and by many
      different working groups for always, propiertary formats will not.<br/>
      The tag language used by HTML is plain human-readable text, which make of it
      an even better standard.
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-size:2em">👊</span>Check quickly what rest to be documented.<b>This will automatically save many
       disputes at work:</b><br/>
       ""You know it was not documented and everybody knows that you knew it, and 
        you know that everyone else knew that you knew it, ..."""
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>

<h2>What the SPB IS NOT:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SPB is to HTML formating what vim is to text-editors: <b>fast, simple and efficient over pretty and complex</b><br/>
       While standard presentations search to impact with visual effects,<b>SPB tries to be
       the Power Point enemy for VERY GOOD REASONS!</b>. Just some links about those reasons:
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">

        </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
<br/>

<h2>How does it Compares to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Note taking apps like Evernote:</b><br/>
        Evernote (and others) are high-level user visual apps.
        They use some form of propietary database format
        to store the content and propietary services to synchronize the
        content. <br/>
        On the other side SPB follows the phylosophy that the database formal
        must be as simple as possible. Actually is plain html (that's, text files).
        This makes of it a much less friendly app for newcommers, but allows
        to reuse many powerfull tools like existing text editors, or
        synchronization mechanisms.<br/>
        The application itself reduces to the embedded Javascript.<br/> 
        It also allows for "complex" things like embedding SVG images,
        videos, iframes or any other technology supported by modern browsers,
        or extend it with standard javascript.<br/>
        SPBs <b>can be embedded/integrated with easy in existing Web sites, Evernotes can NOT</b>.
        <br/>
        Since version 1.1 <b>SPBs allows to create printed books (or sub-books) of the content</b>,
        again by just profiting from standard CSS technology in any modern browser.
        <br/>
        <b>SPBs allows for collaborative work and version control through systems like
            Git, Evernotes doesn't.</b>
        <br/>
        Probably "normal" users will be happie enough with Evernote while
        advanced users who feel confortable with text editors and git
        and/or wants to enhance the power of their web-sites will prefer the
        SPB format.<br/>
   </li>
   <li><b>PowerPoint presentations</b><br/>
       Metaphorically speaking, if <b>Power Point is an Apple Store of documentation 
       in Fifth Avenue</b> where iphones are sold, <b>the SPB is the Apple 
       factory in Asia</b> where document information is stored, assembled and tested.<br/>
   </li>
   <li><b><a hre="https://learnxinyminutes.com/" target="_new">Learn X in Y Minutes</a></b>
       "alike" sites.<br/>
       Learn X in Y minutes (and others like <a href="https://cheat.sh">cheat.sh</a>
       have surged to create a "learn-fast" path for newcomers. They make a great
       job for what they have been designed. Still they will fail once we try
       to get deeper into any complex technology and they don't provide tooling
       like "search-by-topic" in SPB. Learning data-science or IA or modern
       language programming is not about one cheat-sheet, but about many 
       inter-related ones.<br/>
       SPB can be used to create a better "learn X in Y minutes". <br/>
       This is how learn x in y minutes :
       <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/" target="_new">presents java to newcomers</a> and this is how SPB 
       <a href="JAVA/java_map.html" target="_new">presents java to newcomers and seniors developers</a>
   </li>
   <li><b>Zettelkasten knowledge and info management</b>.<br/>
       <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?q=Zettelkastenw&t=web">Zettlekasten</a> follows a set of
       patterns for advanced documention and note-taking.<br/>
       Actually SPB do not compares to, but can be used as a way for "Zettelkasten"ing.<br/>
       Some tools have been developed for Zettelkasten. With SPB, the tool is your browser!.<br/>
       Actually "Zettelkasten"ers looks to like the SPB format according to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/">some comments in reddit</a>.
   </li>
   <li><b>Content Management Systems (CMS)</b>.<br/>
         A CMS is an application running 24x7 in a server "somewhere in the Internet".<br/>
       The SPB is NOT a server or any other type of software, just plain HTML (OK, and 
       some spots of Javascript and CSS). <br/>
         The content on a CMS is stored in a central database running also "somewhere in the Internet"<br/>
       The content on a SPB is the HTML file in your local hard-disk. Since it's HTML (plain text)
       you can use some tool like git to put on a central or distributed system (and branch, fork or
       collaborate with your team). <br/>
        CMS is more user-friendly ... once you have a server running 24x7, and some CMS
       admin is out there to "keep it alive" and the network is up and there are backups in 
       place and users agree of common ussage pattern, and someone/somebody takes charge of 
       cleaning repeated information and same topics are used by anyone, and users are notified
       of other users changes ... and users don't get used to think that the CMS is a place
       to "pile" random word and powerpoint files and care is taken to avoid repeated content 
       in different places (or even worse, different versions of the same content anywhere)
       OK, you know, CMS most of the times does not work as planned. 
       It requires lot of attention and discipline by end users (and CMS administrators).<br/>
   </li>
   <li><b>Wikis</b>.<br/>
       SPB can be seen as a lightweight Wiki. Actually Wikis can be seen as lightweight CMSs.<br/>
       A Wiki ussually also need a server running 24x7 and Wiki operators to maintain it.<br/>
       Similar advantages / disadvantages than in the CMS should apply.
   </li>
   <li><b>Plain  TXT and "Notepad" note taking</b><br/>
       Important things (those that affects thousands of millions of people every day) 
       are <a target="_new" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">written down in txt</a>. <br/>
       HTML and by extension SPB, also likes txt. Just put your important staft inside
       &lt;pre zoom&gt; tags (pre: preformatted).
   </li>
   <li><b>Canvas like boards</b><br/>
       With some minor training on how to layout elements, SPB can also be used as a 
       simple canvas-like application (and again, being pure HTML/txt, you can profit from
       all the "goodies" of git to version or branch your project canvas).<br/>
       With good programming skills it can also be used as a complex canvas-like board,
       by just rendering the HTML "somehow" from a remote server.
</ul>

<h2>Digging into SPB</h2>
  SPB profits from all the excelent work invested in modern
  Web Browsers to provide static and dynamic content:<br/>
  A modern browser can parse and render tens of megabytes of HTML per second,
  and Internet connection is fast enough to play video, so loading page-by-page
  does not make sense anymore.  The cost of a new page requests is much higher
  than the cost of keeping evering in memory.  Also offline navigation comes for
  free.
  <br/>
   Current web sites (and electronic book formats) follow the page-by-page
  inherited from printed-paper. Actually being able to zoom in/out "a la Google
  Maps" provides a much confortable UI in electronic devices. Starting from a zoom-out
  and arranging content properly provides a mind-map of the information for free.
  <br/>
  In practice a SPB book is just a single web page profiting from a thoroughly 
  dessigned CSS and some helper Javascript.<br/>
